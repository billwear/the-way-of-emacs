  <h1>🧠 Building a Pivot Point</h1>
  <p><em>April 6, 2025 &mdash; Drift Season, Day of Planning</em></p>

    <h2>🧠 Core Insight</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “All the others run with the sun.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This line came to me while crawling through attic insulation and trying not to scream at my house wiring. One rogue wire ran <strong>North-South</strong>, while everything else in the house ran <strong>East-West</strong> — sun-aligned. I muttered the line, and then everything in my novel snapped into place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Neptune’s magnetic field aligned with my circuit box. That’s how this works.
    </p>

    <h2>🛠️ Real-World Spark</h2>
    <p>
      In the attic of our legacy home, I was tracing a rogue circuit to the dining room. After hours of crawling and testing, I found the outlier — a wire running south, hidden and long.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “All the others run with the sun.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The pattern stuck. The <em>only</em> N-S line. Everything else? E-W. Like photosynthesis. Like gravity. Like storylines.
    </p>

    <h2>📓 Emologent Fragment</h2>
    <p>"Emologent" stands for "Emotional Log Entry," which is something I do every morning when I wake up.  Build the day around my mood, so that they work together. You can imagine the other permutations of this, mostly all bad.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mood:</strong> 4</li>
      <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Medium</li>
      <li><strong>Social Battery:</strong> Empty</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Fuzzy</li>
      <li><strong>Emotions:</strong> Stirring, Masking, Housework Apathy</li>
      <li><strong>Physical:</strong> Muscle aches, sleep saturation</li>
      <li><strong>Mantra:</strong> <em>“Don’t shine. Just align.”</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This “meh” mood wasn’t a block—it was a mirror. It became Lira’s mood. Her weather system. The key to the artifact.
    </p>

    <h2>📖 Scene Output: <em>“LKA Mode”</em></h2>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Thalassa / Quarters</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Lira blinked at the ceiling. No urgency. No dread. Just a familiar internal haze—like her body had rebooted without the interface fully loading.”
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “Her emotional fog mirrored the cloud decks of Neptune. The artifact knew it, too—it pulsed in the wall with a soft, go-away blue.”
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “Her stimbrew tasted a little less bitter. She could function. Float. Maybe even ghost her way into usefulness.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>This became <strong>Scene 1</strong> in Chapter: <em>The Alignment Event</em>.</p>

    <h2>🌌 Scene Map: Plot Point 1 – <em>The Deviant Line</em></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Observation lab on Triton</li>
      <li><strong>Characters:</strong> Lira, [TBD partner], Hidden Listener</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      “There’s this one line that deviates…”<br>
      [They rotate the 3D field model slowly. The lines glow. One moves.]<br>
      “All the others run with the sun.”<br>
      “What?”<br>
      “They adjust. Like they’re looking for it.”<br>
      “But that’s millions of miles away…”<br>
      “…I know.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🧭 Planning Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lira's moods align with the artifact's behavior.</li>
      <li>The artifact responds to <strong>emotional resonance</strong>, not commands.</li>
      <li>Alignment is not control. It’s cooperation.</li>
      <li>Chapter working title: <em>I Do Not Shine</em></li>
    </ul>
