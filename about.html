    <h1>About The Way of Emacs</h1>
    <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
    <p>Emacs is more than a text editor—it’s a **way of thinking**. It teaches **modularity, adaptability, and signal clarity** in a noisy world. But you don’t have to learn Emacs to benefit from its philosophy.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Way of Emacs</strong> is about applying these principles to life. This is a space for **deep thinkers, builders, and those who want control over their own systems—both digital and personal.**</p>
    
    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>I’m Bill. I’ve spent decades working with Unix, Emacs, and technology. But my real passion is **figuring out how to use tools—not just for efficiency, but for better thinking**. I believe that the right mental models, like the ones Emacs embodies, can make a real difference in how we work and live.</p>
    
    <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Essays on **modularity, signal-vs-noise thinking, and personal mastery**.</li>
        <li>Lessons from Emacs, Unix, and open-source philosophy that apply **beyond tech**.</li>
        <li>Strategies for designing **your own life systems, rather than inheriting someone else’s defaults**.</li>
        <li>A growing library of **practical tools and insights** to help you build a more intentional way of living.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Join the Journey</h2>
    <p>This isn’t a site about Emacs, and it’s not a self-help blog. It’s something in between—a place to explore **how the right tools and mindset can change everything**.</p>
    
    <p>Read, apply, experiment. There’s no one true way—but there are better ways. Let’s find them.</p>
