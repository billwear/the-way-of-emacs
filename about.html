    <h1>about the way of emacs</h1>
  
  <p>There are things I want to say. This site is a place for me to say them.  I have no idea who needs or wants to hear them, but it seems like someone else might get something out of them, so I'm sharing.</p>
    
    <p>At best, I'm an amateur philosopher. Now in my mid-sixties, and feeling like I'm facing extinction in the job market, I'm trying to switch to a mode of interacting that I hope will keep me going.</p>

    <p>I've been thinking about these things for over half a century. Liberal Christian philosophy caught my attention when I was nine, and while the tenets didn't stick, the <em>idea</em> of a workable and coherent credo did.</p>

   <p>What's emerged doesn't seem to bear the stamp of any particular school of thought.  These are just things I want to talk about.</p>
