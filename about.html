    <h1>About the way of emacs</h1>
    <h2>Why this exists</h2>
    <p>Emacs is more than a text editor — it’s a <strong>way of thinking</strong>. It’s about designing systems, shaping workflows, and taking full control of your tools. 
        But you don’t have to use Emacs to apply its core principles.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Way of Emacs</strong> is about taking ownership — of your tools, your work, and your life. It’s for those who refuse to accept defaults and instead 
        build systems that fit who they are.</p>
    
    <h2>Who i am</h2>
    <p>I’m Bill. I’ve spent decades working with Unix, Emacs, and open-source systems. But my real passion is <strong>deliberate design</strong> — figuring out how to 
        build systems, workflows, and mental models that give you control. Emacs is just one example of that philosophy in action.</p>
    
    <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Essays on building intentional systems — both digital and personal.</li>
        <li>Lessons from Emacs, Unix, and open-source thinking that apply beyond tech.</li>
        <li>Strategies for shaping your own workflow instead of inheriting someone else’s defaults.</li>
        <li>A growing library of insights and tools to help you build a system that fits you.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Join the journey</h2>
    <p>This isn’t a site about Emacs, and it’s not a self-help blog. It’s about <strong>crafting your own way forward</strong> — with the right tools, the right mindset, 
        and the willingness to build something better.</p>
    
    <p>Read, apply, experiment. You don’t have to follow someone else’s system. You <strong><em>can</em></strong> design your own. Always own your path.</p>
