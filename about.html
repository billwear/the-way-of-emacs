    <h1>about the way of emacs</h1>
    <h2>why this exists</h2>
    <p>Emacs is more than a text editor—it’s a <strong>way of thinking</strong>. It teaches modularity, adaptability, and signal clarity in a noisy world. But you don’t have to learn Emacs to benefit from its philosophy.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Way of Emacs</strong> is about applying these principles to life. This is a space for deep thinkers, builders, and those who want control over their own systems — both digital and personal.</p>
    
    <h2>who i am</h2>
    <p>I’m Bill. I’ve spent decades working with Unix, Emacs, and technology. But my real passion is figuring out how to use tools — not just for efficiency, but for better thinking. I believe that the right mental models, like the ones Emacs embodies, can make a real difference in how we work and live.</p>
    
    <h2>what you’ll find here</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Essays on modularity, signal-vs-noise thinking, and personal mastery.</li>
        <li>Lessons from Emacs, Unix, and open-source philosophy that apply beyond tech.</li>
        <li>Strategies for designing your own life systems, rather than inheriting someone else’s defaults.</li>
        <li>A growing library of practical tools and insights to help you build a more intentional way of living.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>join the journey</h2>
    <p>This isn’t a site about Emacs, and it’s not a self-help blog. It’s something in between — a place to explore how the right tools and mindset can change everything.</p>
    
    <p>Read, apply, experiment. There’s no one true way — but there are better ways. Let’s find them.</p>
