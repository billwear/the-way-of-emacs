This blog started as a series called /The Way of Emacs/, but now it’s evolving. For the past few weeks, I've been writing a weekly series called /The Way of Emacs/. Originally, it was a way to reflect on my daily Emacs use and share a few hard-won tips from Emacs philosophy. But something’s started to shift.

I’ve realized that my long-term goal — something that might even become a retirement path — is to write science fiction, starting with a novel called /The Neptune Anomaly/.

And instead of keeping those two worlds separate, I’m bringing them together.

This blog is becoming a *running log and tutorial* about *writing a novel in Emacs*. From outlining and worldbuilding in Org mode, to drafting in `writeroom-mode`, to tracking my progress with custom TODO workflows — everything I do, I’ll document here.

*What to Expect*

Each day, I’ll post something short from one or more of these categories:

- 🧠 Emacs as a Writer’s Toolkit: Tools, packages, workflows
- ✍️ Writing Log: My progress on /The Neptune Anomaly/
- 🧰 Configs & Experiments: What’s helping (and what’s not)
- 📚 Process Notes: Thoughts on structure, character arcs, themes
- 📓 “Working in Public”: What it’s like to build a novel from scratch, live

*Why?*

Because I love Emacs. I love writing. And I think others might find value in seeing how those two things collide.

I also love coffee, but you're on your own, there.

If you're an Emacs user, or a writer looking for new ways to organize and stay focused, or just someone curious about the nuts and bolts of building a sci-fi novel, this space is for you.

You can follow the series from the top menu under =The Writer's Toolkit=.

Thanks for reading—and if you're building your own workflow or writing a book, I’d love to hear about it.
