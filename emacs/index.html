      <h1>How I start my day</h1>

      <p>By the time I wake up, my brain is already ten steps into something — yesterday’s mistakes, today’s problems, next week’s rabbit holes. I used to reach for my phone. Now I reach for Emacs. It doesn’t quiet my thoughts, but it gives them a container. And that’s enough.</p>

      <p>My mornings start in a single file — a kind of personal logbook that includes the date, the current “season” (which I made up), and a quote if something’s rattling around in my head. But the heart of it is my <strong>Morning Check-In</strong>, a short, structured journal that helps me get traction before the day picks up speed.</p>

      <p>It opens with a key-chord (<code>Ctrl-m j</code>), and it looks something like this:</p>

* Morning Check-In

** Snapshot
- Mood: solid 6.5
- Energy: buzzy but uneven
- Mental Weather: cloudy with flashes of overplanning

** What's Swirling?
- Need to get the ceiling trim up before anyone sees it
- That API thing I was supposed to circle back to last week
- Also I kinda want to rearrange the entire Emacs config again?

** What’s Pulling Me?
- Drawn toward: fixing everything at once
- Avoiding: actual focused effort on one thing
- Might be better to: choose one low-stakes task and finish it

** Bias / BS Radar
- [X] Impostor vibes
- [ ] Negativity loop
- [ ] I’m fine™ when I’m not
- [X] Too many tabs open
- [ ] Just tired, actually

** Reset Options (Pick One or Skip)
- [ ] Coffee + walk
- [X] 5-minute scribble
- [ ] Name the feeling and move on
- [ ] Let it spin
- [ ] Something sillier: Refile old inbox notes as if they're lost scrolls

** Tiny Wisdom
- You’ve done hard things before. Finish one thing today, even if it’s tiny.

      <p>I don’t always fill out every line. Some days I skip the wisdom. Some days I just click a checkbox and move on. But even the <em>act of opening this</em> slows me down enough to think instead of flail. It reminds me I don’t have to solve everything — I just have to listen long enough to know where I am.</p>

      <p>There’s no productivity system here. No lifehack. Just a ritual that meets me where my mind already is: in motion, a little chaotic, but reachable.</p>

      <p>If your mornings feel like being dragged behind a truck made of stray thoughts and browser tabs, maybe try a check-in of your own. Doesn’t have to be in Emacs. But Emacs gives me the right mix of rhythm and resistance — just enough friction to keep me from skidding out.</p>

      <p>How I start my day isn’t perfect. But it’s mine. It works, and it helps me lean toward focus mode.</p>
