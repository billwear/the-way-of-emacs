      <p>I manage everything — my job, my house, my support queue, my prayer life, my sci-fi worldbuilding — with a handful of <code>.org</code> files and a system I trust more than any app I’ve ever used. This isn’t a productivity flex. It’s survival.</p>

      <p>At the heart of the system is Emacs and <code>org-mode</code>, backed by capture templates, custom TODO states, and one principle: <strong>keep friction where it matters</strong>.</p>

      <hr/>

      <h2>Agenda-Driven Life</h2>
      <p>Here’s how my Emacs is set up to focus on the things I care about:</p>

      <pre><code class="emacs-lisp">
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/etc/org/pdp.org"
                         "~/etc/org/support.org"
                         "~/etc/org/renovation.org"
                         "~/etc/org/neptune.org"))
      </code></pre>

      <p>My agenda view pulls from four key areas: professional goals, community support, house projects, and fiction work. I don’t try to merge them. I just let them show up on the same screen. The overlap reminds me that life is one thing, not four separate apps.</p>

      <hr/>

      <h2>Professional Goals (PDP)</h2>
      <p>In <code>pdp.org</code>, I keep a running list of expectations tied to my role level — these aren’t aspirations, they’re part of the job description. I treat them as scaffolding, not pressure:</p>

      <pre><code>
* Professional Objectives                                :pdp:
** TODO Own project documentation
** TODO Improve architecture understanding
** TODO Give product feedback that lands
** TODO Contribute to team goals as a writing expert
      </code></pre>

      <p>Each of these links to real tasks. I log progress underneath them. It keeps me focused on the kind of person I’m becoming, not just the task list du jour.</p>

      <hr/>

      <h2>Support Is Messy — I Track That Too</h2>
      <p><code>support.org</code> is a wild mix: actual customer support moments, internal questions, home maintenance, and small acts of neighborly triage. I use a capture template to toss these in quickly:</p>

      <pre><code class="emacs-lisp">
("s" "Support [Inbox]" entry
 (file+headline "~/etc/org/support.org" "Inbox")
 "* TODO %?\n  %U\n")
      </code></pre>

      <p>Here’s what a real section might look like:</p>

      <pre><code>
* TODO Pull weeds out front before rain                 :chores:
  <2025-04-14 Mon>
* TODO Answer Jim’s PXE bug question                    :work:
  <2025-04-12 Sat>
* TODO Call neighbor re: loose dog                      :local:
  <2025-04-13 Sun>
      </code></pre>

      <p>This file reminds me that support isn’t just tickets and code — it’s what you choose to carry.</p>

      <hr/>

      <h2>Capture Templates Make This Flow</h2>
      <p>I use capture templates to instantly drop thoughts, tasks, or logs into the right context without ever switching files manually. A few favorites:</p>

      <pre><code class="emacs-lisp">
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("s" "Support [Inbox]" entry
         (file+headline "~/etc/org/support.org" "Inbox")
         "* TODO %?\n  %U\n")
        ("r" "Renovation Task" entry
         (file+headline "~/etc/org/renovation.org" "Projects")
         "* TODO %?  :renovation:\n  %U\n")
        ("l" "Log Entry" entry
         (file+headline "~/etc/org/pdp.org" "Log")
         "* %U %?\n" :empty-lines 1)))
      </code></pre>

      <p>Each one gives me frictionless capture, but keeps tasks filed where they belong.</p>

      <hr/>

      <h2>Friction is a Feature</h2>
      <p>Most people want less friction. I don’t — not always. For habits I want to keep, I make them repeat. But I don’t use tools that hide or snooze them. I <strong>let them accumulate</strong>. That way, when I ignore a habit, it piles up like guilt in my agenda view:</p>

      <pre><code>
* TODO Stretch (repeat every day)                       :habit:
  SCHEDULED: <2025-04-12 Sat +1d>
* TODO Review goals (repeat every Friday)              :habit:
  SCHEDULED: <2025-04-11 Fri +1w>
      </code></pre>

      <p>There’s no “Done” button that resets it. I have to manually mark it. If I ignore it, I see it. That friction is what makes me act. The guilt is the feature.</p>

      <hr/>

      <h2>Everything, Together</h2>
      <p>All of this flows into a single agenda view that might show me:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Professional deliverables</li>
        <li>Support tasks from people I care about</li>
        <li>House projects due before the family reunion</li>
        <li>A prayer list I quietly keep updating</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This system isn’t about minimalism. It’s about visible complexity — managed with quiet tools and loud intentions.</p>

      <p>Plain text. No distractions. Just the life I’m building, one entry at a time.</p>
