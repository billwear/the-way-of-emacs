      <h1>How I start my day</h1>

      <p><em>I don't wake up so much as reboot -- and some mornings, I boot into safe mode.</em></p>
      
      <p>When I wake up, my brain is already searching for an axis of spin. I used to check my e-mail.  Now I open Emacs. It doesn’t quiet my thoughts, but it gives them better access. And that’s enough.</p>

      <p>My mornings start in a single file — a kind of personal logbook that includes the date, the current “season” (which I made up), and a quote if something’s rattling around in my head. But the heart of it is my <strong>Morning Check-In</strong>, a short, structured journal that helps me get traction before the day picks up speed.</p>

      <p>It opens with a key-chord (<code>Ctrl-m j</code>), and it looks something like this:</p>

	  Today is Pungenday, the 30th day of Discord in the YOLD 3191

	  * Temporal Context: 💤 The Dream Archive / 🌫️ The Drift Season

	  Time is an illusion. Morning doubly so.
          -- Douglas Adams

	  * Morning Check-In

	  ** Snapshot
	  - Mood: solid 6.5
	  - Energy: buzzy but uneven
	  - Mental Weather: cloudy with flashes of overplanning

	  ** What's Swirling?
	  - Need to get the ceiling trim up before anyone sees it
	  - That API thing I was supposed to circle back to last week
	  - Also I kinda want to rearrange the entire Emacs config again?

	  ** What’s Pulling Me?
	  - Drawn toward: fixing everything at once
	  - Avoiding: actual focused effort on one thing
	  - Might be better to: choose one low-stakes task and finish it

	  ** Bias / BS Radar
	  - [X] Impostor vibes
	  - [ ] Negativity loop
	  - [ ] I’m fine™ when I’m not
	  - [X] Too many tabs open
	  - [ ] Just tired, actually

	  ** Reset Options (Pick One or Skip)
	  - [ ] Coffee + walk
	  - [X] 5-minute scribble
	  - [ ] Name the feeling and move on
	  - [ ] Let it spin
	  - [ ] Something sillier: Refile old inbox notes as if they're lost scrolls

	  ** Tiny Wisdom
	  - You’ve done hard things before. Finish one thing today, even if it’s tiny.

      <p>I make no particular effort to fill out every line. Some days I skip the wisdom. Some days I just click a checkbox and move on. But even the <em>act of opening this</em> slows me down enough to <em>think</em> instead of <em>flail</em>. It reminds me I don’t have to solve everything — I just have to listen long enough to figure out where I am.</p>

      <p>In itself, this isn't a lifehack productivity system. It's just a ritual that meets me where my mind already is: in motion, a little chaotic, but reachable.</p>

      <p>If your mornings feel like being dragged behind a truck made of stray thoughts and browser tabs, maybe try a check-in of your own. Doesn't have to be mine. Certainly doesn’t have to be in Emacs. But Emacs gives <em>me</em> the right mix of rhythm and resistance — just enough friction to keep me from skidding out.</p>

      <p>How I start my day isn’t perfect. But it’s mine; it works; and it helps me lean into focus.</p>

<h2>Why I think this works</h2>

<p>Look, I’m not running a lab here, or claiming universal truth. But for a brain like mine — fast, nonlinear, distractible, always mid-thought — this little ritual helps. It doesn’t fix everything, but it tilts the odds in my favor.</p>

<p>Here’s what I’ve noticed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It limits decision fatigue.</strong> First thing in the morning, everything is a choice — and every choice burns energy. This check-in keeps me from spending that energy before I even brush my teeth. I know what I’m doing. I don’t have to invent it from scratch. Later on, I'll talk about the "Better-To" system I use to reduce decision fatigue even more.</li>

  <li><strong>It regulates my emotions without me trying to “fix” them.</strong> Just naming what’s going on — “cloudy with flashes of overplanning,” say — gives me some distance. It’s not a meltdown, just the weather.</li>

  <li><strong>It gives me a foothold in the day.</strong> ADHD can make every task feel like a coin toss — will I follow through or vanish into browser tabs? This morning log gives me something I already know how to do. One win before the world starts spinning sets the tone for the rest of the day.</li>

  <li><strong>It builds habits the only way they stick for me: through rhythm, not pressure.</strong> Because it’s tied to something I already love (Emacs), it doesn’t feel like “extra.” It’s just how the day starts, like a cup of coffee for my brain.</li>

  <li><strong>It’s mine.</strong> This format, this system, this language — it’s shaped around how I actually think. Not some productivity guru’s fantasy of discipline. That’s why I keep coming back to it: It fits.</li>
</ul>

<p>So no — it’s not a cure. But it’s a kind of clarity. And for a mind like mine, clarity is gold.</p>
