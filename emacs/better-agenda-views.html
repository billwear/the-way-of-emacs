    <h1>Better Agenda Views with Less Lisp</h1>

      <p><strong>Let’s be honest:</strong> Org Agenda is a brilliant mess. Once you get used to the idea that your entire life is a series of collapsible list items, it’s hard to go back. But then you stare at a screen full of mismatched categories and oversized tag columns and think:</p>

      <blockquote>“Why does everything look... off?”</blockquote>

      <p>Turns out, the default agenda view isn't optimized for people who like visual clarity. It wastes space. The category column is <em>always</em> the same width — even if your categories are one-word long. And that’s the part that finally broke me.</p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Here’s what a typical tags view might look like:</p>

      <pre><code>
  ProjectX:         TODO Write report                  :urgent:
  HomeStuff:        TODO Fix sink                      :chores:
  LongCategoryName: TODO Clean inbox                   :admin:
      </code></pre>

      <p>Notice how all the alignment depends on that longest category? If you’ve got a few outliers, your whole layout suffers.</p>

      <h2>The Fix (Minimal Lisp Required)</h2>
      <p>I didn’t want to write a full display engine. I just wanted the category column to stop hogging space. After some spelunking, I found this:</p>

      <pre><code class="emacs-lisp">
(setq org-agenda-prefix-format
      '((agenda . "  %-12:c%?-12t% s")
        (todo . "  %-12:c")
        (tags . "  %-12:c")
        (search . "  %-12:c")))
      </code></pre>

      <p>That <code>%-12:c</code> controls the width of the category column. If you make it smaller — say <code>%-8:c</code> — suddenly your agenda breathes again.</p>

      <p>Even better, you can ditch the category column entirely in some views:</p>

      <pre><code class="emacs-lisp">
(setq org-agenda-prefix-format
      '((tags . "  %?-12t% s")))
      </code></pre>

      <p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> If you use custom agenda commands, you can tailor prefix formatting per view — making your “writing mode” compact and your “project review mode” more verbose.</p>

      <h2>The Real Win</h2>
      <p>Org Agenda shouldn’t feel like a log file from 1999. With a few tweaks, it becomes clean, focused, and dare I say — joyful?</p>

      <p>I’ve got a bunch more small fixes like this queued up — fewer tweaks, more payoff. And no yak shaving required.</p>
