      <h1>Thought >> Craft</h1>
      <p>I live inside Emacs — for writing, thinking, planning, and remembering. If you’ve ever wondered whether one tool could help you organize your entire creative life, you’re in the right place.</p>

      <p>I’m a technical writer by trade, a sci-fi dreamer by night, and someone who got tired of making dumb mistakes just because my brain runs faster than my process. So I built a system inside Emacs that slows me down just enough to get good work done.</p>

      <h2>What you'll find here:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Writing workflows:</strong> How I outline, draft, revise, and ship longform work in org-mode</li>
        <li><strong>Real-world tools:</strong> Capture templates, agenda views, custom commands — built for friction, not fantasy</li>
        <li><strong>A philosophy:</strong> Small changes. Gentle attention. The art of sustainable focus.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I’m building:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Emacs Writer’s Toolkit:</strong> A pay-what-you-want starter kit (coming soon)</li>
        <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> Live walkthroughs and Q&A (starting this summer)</li>
        <li><strong>Consulting:</strong> For writers and teams who want to build workflows that actually work</li>
      </ul>
