      <h1>Foundations</h1>
      <p>Everyone said that the Organic Chemistry professor was brutal. Rumor was, nobody had ever scored 100% on one of his tests. I did — but I forgot to write my name on it. (Don’t worry, I still got credit.)</p>
      <p>Such is the life of a dreamer — someone whose ambitions fly five steps ahead of reality, who imagines ten impossible futures before breakfast. The downside? Impatience and carelessness. “Let’s just get to the destination — I don’t have time for all this minutiae.”</p>
      <p>This is where I find myself, at 66.25 years old. Better late than never?</p>

      <h2>"Take more pains with your writing."</h2>
      <p>Mrs. MacEwan saw it in second grade. I should’ve listened. It didn’t really catch up to me until tenth-grade math, where sign errors haunted otherwise solid work. Decades of dreaming — always the next idea, the next big thing, the next world-changing result. Funny thing is, I loved <em>Walden.</em></p>
      <p>In fact, I think I still have a coffee mug with Thoreau’s quote: “If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.” I got lost in the first sentence — and forgot about the second.</p>

      <h2>"I'm too old to learn anything new."</h2>
      <p>My dad said that around age 65, when someone — maybe me — asked him about a new technology. “I’m too old to learn anything new.” Cut me like a knife. I swore right then I’d never be like that. And somehow, “still got plenty to learn” became part of me.</p>
      <p>But now, some things are shifting in my career, and I’m looking closer at this old habit of jumping before looking — carelessness fueled by excitement. I’m tired of making dumb mistakes just because I’m in love with the destination and ignoring the journey.</p>

      <h2>"I don't like thinking this way."</h2>
      <p>How do you change something that’s been part of you since age seven? Everyone has an answer — psychological judo, religious practice, commando grit, iron will. Most of it? Not super helpful.</p>
      <p>But some time back, I realized something: just paying attention to your thoughts — really paying attention — can change everything. What if, when I catch myself rushing or making silly mistakes, I just pause and think, “I don’t like thinking this way. I don’t want to be this way. I want to change.”</p>

      <h2>The art of attention</h2>
      <p>These moments usually come in quiet hours. One day it hits you: the world doesn’t care what you do, but *you* might. And the only thing you can really manage? Your mind. Learning to organize it can be a game-changer — even if it doesn’t seem easy.</p>
      <p>For all the big promises of self-help, getting a grip on yourself is often simpler than it sounds. Just observe your thoughts. No declarations. No sweeping change. Just watching. Some people call that “mindfulness.” I’ve never really clicked with that term — it feels too tied to Buddhist practice, and that’s not my lane.</p>
      <p>Especially for dreamers, the mind is constantly generating ideas at Warp 9.9998. You don’t shut that down — you *channel* it. You don’t turn off the sun; you build a solar panel.</p>

      <h2>Paying attention to thoughts</h2>
      <p>Ever try actually listening to your thoughts as they fly past? Where’s your mind drifting? How did it get there?</p>
      <p>Minds aren’t computers — they’re more like overgrown gardens, full of weeds you didn’t plant. So start small. Pay attention. No judgment, no need to analyze everything. Just look for patterns.</p>
      <p>Your mind skips dimensions and loops through old habits you didn’t sign up for. Noticing that opens a door — a little space between thoughts. When you learn to find that space, you can start choosing how to respond, instead of being dragged around by whatever shows up.</p>

      <h2>Truth without hyperbole</h2>
      <p>My go-to phrase lately? “I don’t like thinking this way.” It’s not a command, just a preference. It doesn’t fix anything instantly — but usually, it nudges me toward a better mental place. And the more I say it, the more it shapes me.</p>
      <p>This isn’t about control — it’s about agency. That phrase makes me feel like more than a passenger in my own head. And that’s no small thing.</p>

      <h2>Junkrooms of the mind</h2>
      <p>Over time, I’ve noticed something: a lot of my thoughts don’t actually matter. Once you quiet the noise, the essentials show up. You don’t have to sort through everything — just enough to clear some space. Small steps, one thing at a time. Even if life’s still blurry, a focused mind works better.</p>
      <p>Dreamers are especially tempted to change everything overnight. But big, dramatic shifts almost never stick. Real change? It’s small, focused, and repeated. That’s the whole game.</p>

      <h2>Mild preferences</h2>
      <p>Stating a quiet preference seems to work for me. When I notice certain thoughts, I respond lightly: “I like that thought.” Or, “I don’t like thinking this way.” It sounds almost silly. But it works.</p>
      <p>Life’s not a race or a puzzle to solve — it’s something to experience. Living well takes presence. I’m not into magical manifesting or buzzwordy meditation. But I do think presence changes our relationship to time — gives it texture. And that texture helps us hold on to what matters.</p>
