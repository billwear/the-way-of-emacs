    <em><strong>Emacs is just the metaphor. You're the editor.</strong></em>
    
    <h1>Welcome to The Way of Emacs</h1>
    <p class="date">March 4, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Modern life is loud. Overloaded, overcomplicated, and packed with distractions that pull us away from what matters. But under all that noise, there’s something quieter: a way of working and thinking that is adaptable, intentional, and completely under your control.</p>
    
    <p>This isn’t about software. It’s about a mindset — a system for cutting through the static and shaping life on your own terms. And while Emacs, a powerful text editor, embodies this philosophy, you don’t need to learn Emacs to apply it. You just need to see what’s possible when you stop accepting defaults and start designing your own way forward.</p>
    
    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Life as a Modular System</strong> – Everything is a building block. Skills, habits, workflows — each should be composable, extensible, and replaceable.</li>
        <li><strong>The Pursuit of Signal</strong> – Cut the cruft. Remove distractions. Optimize for clarity, efficiency, and deep focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Thoughtful Control</strong> – Mastery isn’t about following rules; it’s about understanding how to shape your own system.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization Over Convention</strong> – The best solutions are the ones that fit you. Build, tweak, refine — never settle for defaults.</li>
        <li><strong>Plain Text Thinking</strong> – The world overcomplicates things. Keep it simple, readable, and future-proof.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is <strong>The Way of Emacs</strong>, digital sufficiency at its finest. Not a guide to an editor, but a philosophy for deliberate living — where you take control, strip away the unnecessary, and hack life so it works for you.</p>
