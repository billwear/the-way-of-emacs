      <p>Welcome to <em><strong>The Way of Emacs</em></strong>, dedicated to Emacs enthusiasts everywhere.</p>

      <p>Here, I'm capturing the things that I, personally, do with Emacs to make my day and my life easier.  Emacs may be complicated to learn, but it offers one of the most consistent and predictable interfaces: keys usually do what you expect in any situation, and no mouse is needed, unless you like using one.</p>

      <h2>Org-Mode Productivity</h2>

      <p>I use org-mode, almost exclusively, as my productivity tool.  Except where other tools are required by groups I've joined, org-mode is my personal organizer, managing my calendar, my to-do list, my notes, and my reference material.  In org-mode, I track my finances and community activities; manage my shopping lists and projects; and keep my personal journal.</p>

      <h2>Other Functions</h2>
      <p>Emacs also provides a text-based browser that covers my needs about half the time (if the javascript isn't too heavy).  I use <em>ansi-term</em> to do system administration and work with the shell.  Files are managed in the <em>dired sidebar</em>, and packages like <em>ivy</em>, <em>company mode</em>, and <em>magit</em> have been my go-to tools for a very long time.</p>

      <p>In short, Emacs is my the doorway into my digital world. Here is just a sampling of what I'm doing with it, for whomever might be interested.</p>
