      <h1>What is the way of Emacs?</h1>
      <p> It is <strong>creation through context, not
	  constraint</strong>.  Emacs doesn't impose a structure—it lets you
	build one that reflects how you think, you work, and you change.</p>

      <p>It is <strong>A practice of intentional tooling</strong>.  It's not
	just about using tools; it's about tuning them to your hand, your
	habits, your needs. Not off-the-shelf productivity, but hand-forged
	fluency.</p>

      <p>It is <strong>the long game of becoming fluent with your own
	  mind</strong>.  Emacs is a mirror and a medium. It rewards those who
	want to build their own mental terrain, one keybinding, one function,
	one file at a time.</p>

      <p>It is <strong>a slow craft in a world obsessed with
	  speed</strong>.  It’s slower to start, but deeper to
	  grow. Emacs users don’t just open a program. They invest in
	  a system—one that compounds.</p>

      <p>It is <strong>A philosophy of literate life</strong>.  Whether
	you're writing fiction, technical docs, journal entries, code, or
	capture templates—Emacs is where words meet structure, and structure
	meets meaning.
      <p>If these virtues appeal to you, then you're probably in the
      right place.</p>
