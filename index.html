<title>Way of Emacs</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>I'm Bill Wear, Electrical Engineer by training, Emacs aficiondo by choice. I live in the United States, in the deep South.</p>
<p>I started using Emacs in 1994, when  a coworker showed it to me. Been using it, off and on, ever since. I don't remember when I started using org mode, but I'm pretty sure it was very soon after the first version became available.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've written and lost more eLisp code than I can remember, and declared .emacs bankruptcy dozens of times.</p>
.p>Come along for the ride as I document the weird and wonderful world of Emacs.</p>
