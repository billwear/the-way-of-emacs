      <h1>Tuning the chaotic mind</h1>
      <p>For the easily distracted — the fast thinkers, the over-committers, the ones who forget what they were doing mid-thought — having a system matters. Emacs works surprisingly well as that system. The key chords, the intentional friction, and the breadth of deeper complexity slow the spin just enough to stay with the work instead of bouncing.</p>

      <p>For some of us, Emacs becomes more than a text editor — it turns into a home: a place for writing, thinking, planning, and remembering. If you’ve ever wondered whether one tool could complement your nine-steps ahead thinking style and support your entire life, you're in the right place.</p>

      <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>

      <p>Mindfulness at warp speed isn’t a contradiction — it’s a necessity for some of us. I’m significantly neurodivergent, and Emacs has become the toolkit that helps me stay present, organized, and creative without trying to force myself into someone else’s idea of focus. What I share here isn’t a system to fix you; it’s a set of tools that work wonders for me, and might help you find your own rhythm.</p>

      <ul>
	<li><strong>Emacs as a grounding system:</strong> Thoughtful workflows that calm the spin without killing momentum.</li>
	<li><strong>Tools for staying with the moment:</strong> Capture flows, habits, and subtle nudges that keep you aligned with your intent.</li>
	<li><strong>Practice over productivity:</strong> Gentle structure for clarity, presence, and sustainable creative focus — not hustle.</li>
	<li><strong>The Better-To system:</strong> A mindful method for noticing what you’re doing and gently shifting toward something better, in real time.</li>
      </ul>
