<h1>* The Way of Emacs</h1>

<p>Welcome to <strong>The Way of Emacs</strong> — a path toward using Emacs not just as a text editor, but as an extension of your mind. Writing. Thinking. Building. Organizing. Deep focus in a shallow world.</p>

<h2>** Why Emacs?</h2>
<p>Because real tools are built to serve you, not the other way around. Emacs is endlessly customizable — not to waste your time, but to make your time matter more. Here, we don't chase plugins. We build habits, systems, and lives that last.</p>

<h2>** What You'll Find Here</h2>
<p>You'll find guides, reflections, and practical workflows focused on one thing: using Emacs to think deeper, write better, and create more freely. This isn't about configuration for its own sake — it's about choosing the right tools, at the right time, for the right work.</p>

<h2>** The Daily Way</h2>
<p>Great systems aren't built all at once. They're shaped, refined, and grown through small, steady practice. The Way of Emacs is about crafting a daily rhythm — not a sprawling setup you'll never actually use, but a living workspace that supports real work and real goals.</p>

<h2>** How This Site is Organized</h2>
<p>The main sections you'll find are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home</strong> — This page. Your first step.</li>
<li><strong>Toolkit</strong> — Practical Emacs configurations, workflows, and examples you can start using today.</li>
<li><strong>Journal</strong> — Reflections, experiments, and lessons learned from walking the Way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start simple. Grow steady. Build a life, not just a setup.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Way.</p>
