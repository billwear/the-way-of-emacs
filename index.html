      <h1>Build your own lab</h1>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>Solder & Signal</strong> ‚Äî a place to rediscover the joy, skill, and freedom of hands-on electronics. In a world of ready-made tech, I build from scratch. Start small. Grow strong. Join me.</p>
      <h2>Why I build</h2>
      <p>I'm launching a series of simple, practical projects to help you get your hands on real circuits ‚Äî no engineering degree required. Even modest builds can boost your confidence, expand your skills, and connect you to a world of builders and makers.</p>
      <p>At 66 years old, I‚Äôm carving a path toward a meaningful, stable, and affordable retirement ‚Äî and I'm inviting you to walk it with me. Out of all the side-hustles, hobbies, and crafts out there, I chose teaching electronics. Why? Because both the subject (electronics) and the act of teaching it matter deeply to me.</p>
      <p>My promise? I'll reveal this world step-by-step, on a tight budget, using household materials wherever possible. You'll need a few components and tools along the way ‚Äî but nothing fancy, and nothing you can‚Äôt gather slowly, affordably, and confidently.</p>

      <h2>Building with Balance</h2>
      <p>Hobbies should lift your life, not crowd it. Responsibilities come first ‚Äî always. The best way to grow a hobby is to weave it into your downtime. If you usually relax with three hours of TV, maybe watch two and spend one hour learning, tinkering, and building.</p>
      <p>When the dishes are done, the bills are paid, and the day's work is finished, you have a choice: drift into sleep ‚Äî or build something real, something yours. The choice is yours to make, every day.</p>
      <h2>Learning by doing</h2>
      <p>Read before you start. Read while you build. Read again when things don't work the way you expected. That's the rhythm of real learning.</p>
      <p>The best time to build is before you feel ready. Wires will cross, mistakes will happen, fuses will blow ‚Äî and every "Oops!" moment will teach you something priceless. These are the sparks that light the way forward.</p>

<h2>How This Site is Organized</h2>
<p>You'll find three main sections in the menu:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home</strong> ‚Äî You're here now. Welcome.</li>
<li><strong>Projects</strong> ‚Äî A growing catalog of hands-on builds, starting simple and getting stronger over time.</li>
<li><strong>Journal</strong> ‚Äî Reflections, lessons, and practical tips from the workbench and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start where you are. Build what you can. Grow stronger every day. And above all ‚Äî be careful with that soldering iron.</p>
