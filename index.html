      <h1>Foundations</h1>
      <p>Everybody said that Organic Chemistry professor was extremely hard.  Rumors flew that nobody had every made 100% on one of his tests.  I did, but I forgot to write my name on it (don't worry, I still got credit).</p>
      <p>Such is the life of a dreamer, whose ambitions fly five steps ahead of current reality -- someone who imagines five to ten impossible futures a day. The drawbacks, though?  Impatience and carelessness run rampant:  "Let's just get to the destination, I haven't got time to waste with this minutia."</p>
      <p>This is where I find myself at 66.25 years old.  Better late than never?</p>
      <h2>"Take more pains with your writing."</h2>
      <p>Mrs. MacEwen already knew this about me in second grade.  Should've listened.  It wasn't an issue until tenth-grade math, where sign errors plagued my otherwise perfectly-understood math.  Decades of practice dreaming about the next thing, the next big idea, the next world-changing result. The funny thing is that I loved <em>Walden</em>.</p>
      <p>I think I even have a coffee cup with one of Thoreau's famous quotes from that essay: "If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them."  Got lost in the first sentence, forgot about the second one.</p>
      <h2>"I'm too old to learn anything new."</h2>
      <p>My own father, retiring at about 65, said something that drove me to never give up.  Someone -- maybe me -- asked him about a new technology.  His answer? "I'm too old to learn anything new." Cut me like a knife.  I vowed in that moment <em>never</em> to be that way.  And somehow, that whole "still got plenty to learn" mantra has become a part of me.</p>
      <p>Some things are happening in my career that make me want to take a closer look at this bad habit of leaping before looking, this carelessness driven by excitement and impatience.  Tired of making stupid mistakes because I'm in love with the destination, but don't care for the journey.</p>
      <h2>"I don't like thinking this way."</h2>
      <p>How do you change something that's been with you since at least age seven? Well, it doesn't help that there are more answers than there are people <em>giving</em> you answers: psychological judo; religious practice; commando training; iron will.  The list is long and generally useless.</p>
      <p>Some time back, I realized that paying attention to your thoughts -- and being honest with yourself about them -- could have a profound effect on everything about you.  What if, when I catch myself in those silly mistakes, I just think, "I don't like thinking this way. I don't like being this way.  I want to change."</p>
      <h2>The art of attention</h2>
      <p>These moments come at quiet hours. One day it hits you that the indifferent world keep turning, and you realize that the only thing we can really manage is our mind. Ordering the mind can be liberating.  At first blush, it doesn't seem easy to do.</p>
      <p>For all the grand gestures and radical self-help ideas, getting control of yourself is a lot simpler than you'd expect: just observe your thoughts.  No grand declaration of ambitious goals; no bold, sweeping changes.  Those really miss the point entirely.  Some call it "mindfulness," but I've never exactly understood what that means, and worse, I don't really like the way that idea is coupled into Buddhist religious practices.</p>
      <p>Especially for dreamers, our minds are generating ideas at Warp 9.9998. Reining it in would be both impossible and detrimental to our mental health.  You don't turn off the sun, you harness the energy in safe and productive ways.</p>
      <h2>Paying attention to thoughts</h2>
      <p>Did you ever try actually considering your thoughts as they're sweeping through your mind?  Listen to your mind and take stock: where's it wandering to, and how did it get there?  Minds are often compared to computers, but more often it feels to me like an untended garden, overgrown with concerns that may not even be mine.  So the first step is to just start paying attention in odd moments.</p>
      <p>It helps me to re-start mental auditing <em>without</em> judgment, and with no rush to decrypt my thoughts.  Just look for patterns.  Your mind churns, leaps, skips dimensions, caught in habit loops I didn't consciously choose.  Noticing this opens a door -- a small space between thoughts.  After learning to find that space quickly, we can then move on to doing something about what we're thinking.</p>
      <p>At some point, I can shift to choosing a response, rather than being dragged along by every impulse. This is not about control in the traditional sense, just choosing less reflexive and more intentional responses.  Making small judgments at this point can begin to have noticeable impacts on you.</p>
      <h2>Truth without hyperbole</h2>
      <p>One of my most powerful tools for change is the little mantra above, "I don't like thinking this way."  I'm telling myself what to think, just expressing a preference.  It doesn't work immediately, except that I usually change the subject mentally, at least for a while.  The more I repeat this preference, though, the stronger it becomes.  Eventually I start to realize that I've changed.</p>
      <p>This small act doesn't put me in the driver's seat, but it makes me more than just a passenger. I feel more in control, more valued, more respected by my own mind.  That's not a small thing.</p>
      <h2>Junkrooms of the mind</h2>
      <p>As I've grown -- very slowly -- in this practice of attention, something's become clear: much of what occupies my thoughts is unnecessary. Quiet the mental noise and we see more clearly what truly matters. We focus, not on everything, but on the essentials. We pare down, not by force, but by simple preferences.</p>
      <p>It's no escape from complexity, just a more measured way of dealing with intricacy.  Small steps, manageable pieces, one thing at a time. A more focused mind works better, even if things are still blurry.</p>
      <p>As a dreamer, it's tempting, in moments of ambition, to think that I should change everything all at once, that the path to mastery or peace requires a sudden, dramatic shift. But this is rarely the case. In truth, most lasting changes come from small, focused, repeated actions.</p>
      <h2>Mild preferences</h2>
      <p>Simply stating a mild preference seems to work for me.  As I notice thoughts, I can very lightly address the ones that seem particularly good or bad: "I like having that thought;" "I don't like thinking this way." It seems trivial, ineffective, and very new-agey.  But it is, in fact, life-changing.</p>
      <p> Life isn't a race or an unsolved problem, but an experience.  Living well requires some presence.  I don't buy into obviously mooning meditations, transformatinal vocabulary, or magical mental wish fulfullment.  Presence changes our perception of time just enough to give things a little more texture -- which means we hold on better, which means we interact more meaningfully.</p>
