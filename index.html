    <p>In <a href="https://williamwear.substack.com/p/let-there-be-light">my life's weird, winding work</a>, I try to organize meaning in evolutions of increasing clarity: first by context, then priority, then incremental complexity, and finally increasing clarity of intent.</p>
    <p>In terms of writing my .emacs, that translates to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>core before extensions.</li>
      <li>workflow before convenience and automation.</li>
      <li>constraints before integrated solutions.</li>
      <li>focus over distraction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I want Emacs to come up fast and clean, and leave me with a blank page where I can start speaking my truth.  Saying this in eLisp:</p>
    <pre>
;;
;; 1. disable the startup screen
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
;; why: removes the splash screen with GNU
;; text and random help — clears the path to
;; your content.
;; 
;; 2. remove the initial scratch buffer message
(setq initial-scratch-message "")
;; why: makes the scratch buffer feel like a
;; blank slate, ready for anything.
;;
;; 3. skip loading package.el before init
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
;; why: if you're using use-package or your
;; own package bootstrap, this avoids double
;; loading.
;;
;; 4. don't load site-wide defaults
(setq inhibit-default-init t)
;; why: prevents Emacs from loading
;; /etc/emacs/default.el or other
;; sysadmin-defined settings.
;;
;; 5. Skip custom file (or isolate it)
(setq custom-file
      (locate-user-emacs-file "custom.el"))
(load custom-file 'noerror)
;;
;; why: prevents Emacs from cluttering your
;; .emacs with setq lines every time you
;; change a setting from the UI.
;;
;; 6. Don’t show toolbars, menu or scroll bars
;;
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
;;
;; why: frees up space, especially on small
;; screens.
;;
;; 7. Prevent frame resizing for font changes
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)
;;
;; why: prevents font size tweaks from
;; adjusting your window layout on startup.
;;
;; 8. Disable file dialog and dialog boxes
(setq use-file-dialog nil)
(setq use-dialog-box nil)
;; why: avoids GUI popups i don't want,
;; especially useful in terminal or mobile
;; environments.
;;
;; 9. Turn off blinking cursor
(blink-cursor-mode 0)
;; why: reduces visual distraction.
;;
;; 10. no beep, no visible bell
(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
;; why: makes Emacs less shouty when you hit
;; the edge of something.
;;
    </pre>
    <p>Next, I'll work on sane package loading, that defers as many packages as possible until they're actually needed.  In other words, if you bring the whole toolbox over to begin with, all you've done is moved the problem, not found the solution you need right now.</p>
