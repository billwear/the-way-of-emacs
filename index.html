      <h1>Tuning mental chaos</h1>
      <p>For the easily distracted — the fast thinkers, the over-committers, the ones who forget what they were doing mid-thought — having a system matters. Emacs works surprisingly well as that system. The key chords, the intentional friction, and the breadth of deeper complexity slow the spin just enough to stay with the work instead of bouncing.</p>

      <p>For some of us, Emacs becomes more than a text editor — it turns into a home for writing, thinking, planning, and remembering. If you’ve ever wondered whether one tool could complement your nine-steps ahead thinking style and support your entire life, you're in the right place.</p>

      <h2>Mindfulness at Warp Speed</h2>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>Emacs as a grounding system:</strong> Thoughtful workflows that help you focus without slowing your mind.</li>
	<li><strong>Tools for staying with the moment:</strong> Capture templates, habits, and friction that bring you back to now.</li>
	<li><strong>Practice over productivity:</strong> Gentle structures for clarity, presence, and sustainable creative energy.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>What I’m building:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Emacs Writer’s Toolkit:</strong> A pay-what-you-want starter kit (coming soon)</li>
        <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> Live walkthroughs and Q&A (starting this summer)</li>
        <li><strong>Consulting:</strong> For writers and teams who want to build workflows that actually work</li>
      </ul>
