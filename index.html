      <h1>foundations</h1>
      <p>Everybody said that Organic Chemistry professor was extremely hard.  Rumors flew that nobody had every made 100% on one of his tests.  I did, but I forgot to write my name on it (don't worry, I still got credit).</p>
      <p>Such is the life of a dreamer, whose ambitions fly five steps ahead of current reality -- someone who imagines five to ten impossible futures a day. The drawbacks, though?  Impatience and carelessness run rampant:  "Let's just get to the destination, I haven't got time to waste with this minutia."</p>
      <p>This is where I find myself at 66.25 years old.  Better late than never?</p>
      <h2>"Take more pains with your writing."</h2>
      <p>Mrs. MacEwen already knew this about me in second grade.  Should've listened.  It wasn't an issue until tenth-grade math, where sign errors plagued my otherwise perfectly-understood math.  Decades of practice dreaming about the next thing, the next big idea, the next world-changing result. The funny thing is that I loved <em>Walden</em>.</p>
      <p>I think I even have a coffee cup with one of Thoreau's famous quotes from that essay: "If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them."  Got lost in the first sentence, forgot about the second one.</p>
      <h2>"I'm too old to learn anything new."</h2>
      <p>My own father, retiring at about 65, said something that drove me to never give up.  Someone -- maybe me -- asked him about a new technology.  His answer? "I'm too old to learn anything new." Cut me like a knife.  I vowed in that moment <em>never</em> to be that way.  And somehow, that whole "still got plenty to learn" mantra has become a part of me.</p>
      <p>Some things are happening in my career that make me want to take a closer look at this bad habit of leaping before looking, this carelessness driven by excitement and impatience.  Tired of making stupid mistakes because I'm in love with the destination, but don't care for the journey.</p>
      <h2>"I don't like thinking this way."</h2>
      <p>How do you change something that's been with you since at least age seven? Well, it doesn't help that there are more answers than there are people <em>giving</em> you answers: psychological judo; religious practice; commando training; iron will.  The list is long and generally useless.</p>
      <p>Some time back, I realized that paying attention to your thoughts -- and being honest with yourself about them -- could have a profound effect on everything about you.  What if, when I catch myself in those silly mistakes, I just think, "I don't like thinking this way. I don't like being this way.  I want to change."</p>
      <p>I think I'll try this.  Let you know how it turns out.</p>
