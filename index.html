      <h1>overcoming sloppy workmanship</h1>
      <p>I confess. For most of my life, impatience and carelessness has ruled, and I'm in my mid-60's.  I mean, I've made it this far, but my patience is wearing thin with this behavior.  It's time to change.</p>
      <p>That probably sounds strange coming from someone who's 66.25 years old.  My own father, retiring at about 65, said something that drove me to never give up.  Someone -- maybe me -- asked him about a new technology.  His answer? "I'm too old to learn anything new."</p>
      <p>Cut me like a knife.  I vowed in that moment <em>never</em> to be that way.  And somehow, that whole "still got plenty to learn" mantra has become a part of me.</p>
      <p>Some things are happening in my career that make me want to take a closer look at a bad, old habit -- or maybe it's a trait -- that has haunted me since tenth grade: careless driven by excitement and impatience.  My big problem with math was sign errors and other, similar, stupid mistakes that were easily avoided with a little more care.</p>
      <p> To be honest, it's probably been around longer.  I remember my second-grade teacher vividly, saying to me "You need to take more pains."  Obviously my enthusiasm got ahead of my workmanship, and it still does.  It's now officially a pain in the neck, and I'm tired of my neck hurting.</p>
      <h2>changing</h2>
      <p>But how do you change something that's been with you since at least seven years old?</p>
      <p>Well, there's always psychological judo: "Use the energy of that trait to conquer it."  That used to impress me, and maybe it's right in this case, but I'm going to have to work it out.  I'm going to do that here on the front page for a while, and this will slowly gravitate toward the "lore" section.  Keep watch.</p>
