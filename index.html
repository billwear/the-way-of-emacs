    <h1>the way of emacs</h1>

    <p>Modern life is too loud: overloaded, overcomplicated, and packed with distractions that pull us away from what matters. Digital absorption drains time, energy, and focus — until it starts chipping away at your income, relationships, and well-being.</p>

    <p>Beneath the noise, there’s something quieter and far more powerful: a way of working and thinking that is adaptable, intentional, and completely under your control.</p>
    
    <p>Don't worry, this isn’t about <em>learning</em> Emacs (a very powerful text editor). It’s about what Emacs represents: a unique system for cutting through static and shaping life on your own terms. Emacs embodies this philosophy, but you don’t need to use it. Let’s treat it as a metaphor for a composable, modular, intentional life.</p>

    <p>You might want to discover what’s possible when you stop accepting defaults and start designing your own way forward.</p>
    
    <h2>core principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Life as a modular system</strong> – Everything is a building block. Skills, habits, workflows — each should be composable, extensible, and replaceable.</li>
        <li><strong>The pursuit of signal</strong> – Cut the cruft. Remove distractions. Optimize for clarity, efficiency, and deep focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Thoughtful control</strong> – Mastery isn’t about following rules; it’s about understanding how to shape your own system.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization over convention</strong> – The best solutions are the ones that fit you. Build, tweak, refine — never settle for defaults.</li>
        <li><strong>Plain text thinking</strong> – The world overcomplicates things. Keep it simple, readable, and future-proof.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Digital sufficiency at its finest means taking control, living deliberately, dropping what doesn't work for you, and hacking the rest so it does.</p>
    
    <p>This is <strong>The Way of Emacs</strong>: Lead when called; follow when right; but always own your path.</p>
