      <h2>Building a Pivot Point</h2>
      <p>There are almost as many ways to build a novel as there are people who write books about how to build a novel.  Almost.</p>
      <p>I've read some of them: one book was memorable, but didn't fit me very well.  Another was weird, but finishable.  The rest were un-finishable.</p>
      <p>Nevermind those.  I'm winging it here.</p>
      <h2>Drawing on Experience</h2>
      <p>Specifically, I'm logging my moods every day, journaling my days at the end, and coming up with mantras that describe the day. Then I get flashes of insight that turn my mantras into plot points, characterization, scene-setting, and so forth. This weekend has been a case in point.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I was in the attic of our legacy home (we're renovating), trying to find the one open circuit needed for the dining room.  It's off an "L" in the house, so it runs N-S, while everything else runs E-W.  I finally found it, and it was way the heck on the west side of the house, the wire running all the way from the breaker box on the east wall.  No wonder it was hidden.  But with a circuit tester and some curiosity, I found it fairly quickly.</p>
      <p>This will be the only circuit that runs N-S in the house.  The rest, as I put it, "run with the sun."  Epiphany.</p>
      <p>Part of my plot is an artifact found in the clouds of Neptune that can transmit when the planet's magnetic field aligns with it's polar spin (it's famously 47 degrees off, which is noteworthy).  My casual little rhyme made me think of having one field line that diverges, but having the others choose to follow the sun.  <em>Choose</em>, mind you, not do it accidentally.  First little piece of the puzzle.  I can put the physics under it later.  Here's my journal entry that sparked this idea:</p>
      <p>"well, helluva day.  i sold a little radio, and possibly made a new friend; bought some veggies at a roadside stand, some of which were cooked with the roast we're having for supper; bought the veggies, and later kitty litter and water (for coffee) for net $1; got the transitions down for the middle bedroom and bathroom (the sitting room archway needed some puttying, so that's drying); got upstairs and found the open breaker; separated the dining room from the kitchen (hot, even); got the #6 breaker wire untangled from everything and ready to go north to the dining room (all the other wires <strong><em>run with the sun</em></strong>);  then stopped to get better piping for the A/C condensate drain, which has been dripping on the framing and made some of the boards pretty rotten; oh, and i replaced the rotten boards and fixed up the superstructure.  got the condensate drainpipe down to the ground, elbowed, and out into the yard a bit, so it's not dripping next to the house.  that was nasty, so i jumped in the shower, and here i am.  going later to take roast & veggies to sharan's dad, who got worn out pressure-washing our house today (he got about halfway around it).  it was a day of crafting for sure, and drifting a little didn't bother me at all."</p>
      <p>I saw that little gem and ran with it:</p>
      <pre>
	- Lira and another character (TBD) reviewing field line data
	- One field line deviates. The others bend sunward
	- Dialogue:
	  - "There's this one line that deviates..."
	  - "All the others run with the sun."
	  - "What?"
	  - "They adjust. Like they're choosing to point toward it."
	  - "But that's millions of miles away."
	  - "I know..."
	- External mystery introduced; emotional resonance building

      <h2>A "Meh" Wake-up Mood</h2>
      <p>I've been getting my main character psychology from myself.  One of the ways I do this is waking up to an "emologent" (EMOtional LOG ENTry).  Today's was gold:</p>

      </pre>
      <p>When I studied this, I saw something for my main character, Lira (but I didn't yet know that these two things would fit together)?</p>
      <pre>
(Lira Waking in LKA Mode, Aboard the Thalassa)

Lira woke to the faint hum of the ship’s thermal exchangers — not a harsh alarm, just the persistent heartbeat of the Thalassa keeping its crew warm in Neptune’s orbit.

She blinked at the ceiling for a while. No urgency. No dread. Just a familiar internal haze, like her body had rebooted without the user interface fully loading.

Ironic, really.  She could chart storms on planets she’d never touched, predict cyclonic behavior in alien stratospheres.  But her own emotional pressure system?  Unmapped. Turbulent. And today — running low pressure, low visibility, and an 80% chance of fog.


---

Her quarters were compact, but they were hers.  Pale lighting flickered on as she sat up, elbows on knees, spine folding like origami.  This was LKA mode — Low-Key Active. She wasn’t at full power, but she could float. She could function.

She slid off the cot, moved like water toward the utility alcove, and brewed the bitter stimblend that passed for coffee up here. No mirror check. No neural uplink. Just the baseline rituals of survival.

The ship’s systems didn’t care about her mood — but her artifact might.  It pulsed faintly in the wall socket behind the desk, its readings always a little sharper when she was off.  Almost like it forecasted her, too.

It's coloration changed to a pale "go-away blue," uninteresting but still faintly attractive. From somewhere came a faint sense that it was generating white noise to cancel the humming ship. Somehow even the faux coffee tasted better. Unexpected but welcome; maybe she could at least be an effective ghost today.
      </pre>
      <p>I like it.  It probably will get rewritten more than once, but I like it.</p>
      <h2>Conversation with a Friend</h2>
      <p>Before actually getting up -- and empty social battery aside -- I did have a short conversation with a trusted friend.  They were trying to help me come up with a mantra to get through a day that will require church, some electrical work, and a nice dinner to help celebrate my wife's birthday and our anniversary (they're back-to-back).</p>
      <p>They suggested, "Don't shine. Just align."</p>
      <p>Another epiphany.  Suddenly, the whole chapter came together, probably the plot point spinning Act 1 into Act 2.  Here's how i diagrammed it for further work:</p>
      <pre>
* Chapter: Alignment Event :chapter:nucleus:
:PROPERTIES:
:author: me
:status: core draft
:theme: resonance, alignment, myth-tech interface
:emotional-arc: LKA → curiosity → awe
:timestamp: <2025-04-06>
:END:

** Scene 1: Lira Wakes in LKA Mode :scene:wake:LKA:
:PROPERTIES:
:mood: low-key active
:location: Thalassa / personal quarters
:tags: morning, interior, setup
:END:
- Lira wakes with emotional fog, physical ache, internal stillness
- Mental weather mirrors Neptune's storms
- The artifact remains passive but pulsing in the background
- Coffee. No mirrors. Rituals of quiet survival
- Foreshadowing: "Feels like the artifact's watching me back today."

** Scene 2: The Magnetic Deviation :scene:plot-point-1:discovery:
:PROPERTIES:
:mood: analytical tension
:location: magneto lab / nav display
:tags: anomaly, alignment, dialogue
:END:
- Lira and another character (TBD) reviewing field line data
- One field line deviates. The others bend sunward
- Dialogue:
  - "There's this one line that deviates..."
  - "All the others run with the sun."
  - "What?"
  - "They adjust. Like they're pointing toward it."
  - "But that's millions of miles away."
  - "I know..."
- External mystery introduced; emotional resonance building

** Scene 3: Artifact Speaks / Alignment Trigger :scene:resonance:event:
:PROPERTIES:
:mood: mythic shift
:location: lab / artifact interface deck
:tags: artifact, myth-tech, transmission
:END:
- Solar wind intensifies; field alignment peaks
- Artifact pulses in Lira's voice: "I do not shine. I just align."
- Magnetic fields lock to solar vector
- Rift transmitter system activates partially
- Lira stunned. No alarms. Just... **response**

** Notes:
- This sequence defines Lira's emotional-mythic link to the artifact
- Artifact is not reactive to logic—only to resonance
- Alignment of emotional state + planetary system = key to activation

plot point 1

* Plot Point 1: The Deviant Line                          :neptune:magnetism:
** Scene
- Setting: Observation station orbiting Triton
- Characters: Archivist, Trainee, Hidden Listener
- Dialogue:
  - “There’s this one line that deviates…”
  - [They rotate the 3D field model slowly. The lines glow. One moves.]
  - “All the others run with the sun.”
  - “What?”
  - “They adjust. Like they’re looking for it.”
  - “But that’s millions of miles away…”
  - “…I know.”

(much later)

* Scene: First Alignment :artifact:dialogue:neptune:
- Setting: Observatory deck, magneto field lab, low lighting
- Lira in LKA mode, reviewing anomaly drift logs
- Artifact pulses subtly—barely perceptible
- Her own bio-rhythm syncs; solar wind intensity climbs
- Audio resonance spikes, then clears
- Her voice plays back from artifact:  
  > “I do not shine. I just align.”
- She says aloud: “What the hell does that mean?”
- All magneto telemetry locks to sun-facing vector
      </pre>
      <p>And just like that, I have something to write toward (put the foundation under this in the first part of the book), and something to spin from (What does this mean? What happens next?)</p>
      <p>Happy writing.</p>
