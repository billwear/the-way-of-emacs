      <h1>Init file audit mode</h1>
      <p>There's a popular habit amongst dedicated Emacs users called "init-file bankruptcy."  When the <code>.emacs</code> file gets overwhelmingly complicated — especially when things get buggy — it's quite common to sideline the current init file and start over.</p>
      <p>Two ways to do this: (1) copy the current file to <code>.o</code> and start bringing things back in, one by one, or (2) just start with a blank init file and add things as they annoy you.</p>
      <p>This second mode is sometimes called "audit mode:" You watch yourself trying to use features from the old init file and /recreate/ them (not copy them).  It's a way of evolving the system as you go.</p>
      <p>I'm currently in this mode now, so I'll be reporting sporadically in this project about the things I've recreated and how it's going.</p>
