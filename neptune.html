  <h1>They run with the sun</h1>
  <section>
    <p>They didn't think Lira had another Great Red Spot in her. Ghosts of a one-trick pony who knew great thinkers in her day, surrounded by giants who brought her enough scraps to find an answer. But a Nobel is impressive enough to buy some clout, and some prime space above Neptune. So she made Thalassa her home.</p>
    <p>The deep cobalt hues of the panoramic display walls, painted with layered telemetry, made it easy for Lira to lose track of life: pulsing auroral bursts, rotational harmonics, magnetic contour models. Data trails hung like frozen lightning bolts. Voyager legacy logs in red, Thalassa's live field data in blue.</p>

<p>Lira sat cross-legged in the dsta well, tugging at threads, Maxwell's equations the only visible constant. The hum of analysis loops played like wind through reeds. Not much of a starting point.</p>

<p>Tallis entered quietly. Grizzled, minimalist, hard to rattle; by the standards of this century, a virtual Luddite. Once he did magnetohydrodynamics. Once. He watched her work before speaking.</p>

<p>"You planning on sleeping this cycle?"</p>

<p>"Sleep’s a waste when you’re watching a god breathe," Lira said without turning.</p>

<p>"Still chasing that deviating field line?"</p>

<p>"There. It's right there," said Lira, pointing to a rotating 3D field model. "It curls wide — too wide — for its flux origin. And it moves ... not with the planet’s spin, but <em>against</em> it. Like it’s anticipating the next shift.  All the others run with the sun."</p>

<p>"We’ve cataloged a dozen anomalous loops. You think this one’s different?"</p>

<p>"Yes. This one’s consistent across three rotations. All the others precess and collapse, but this one… it holds its arc. Watch."</p>

<p>She fast-forwarded the last 48 hours. Most field lines spiral and collapse with the churn of Neptune’s inner flows. One thread — a slender arc glowing gold — looped wide and settled into a repeating pattern. A pulse traveled along it like a ripple, hitting a harmonic peak every 16.11 hours.</p>

<p>"That’s Neptune’s sidereal rotation period," said Tallis.</p>

<p>"Exactly. But this isn’t just aligned. It’s... locked. Field coherence down to four decimal places. No internal storm should be able to do that."</p>

<p>"You cross-checked with the Voyager dataset?" He was leaning in, interested now.<p>

<p>"Two centuries ago, Voyager 2 logged a magnetic deviation on its outbound path. Just a spike — a 1.2 milligauss blip — then gone. But the orientation matches this arc within 0.3 degrees."</p>

<p>"Active since 1989?"</p>

<p>"Active since I don't know when. Voyager was just the first to fly through it. I ran a spectral cross-correlation. That blip? It wasn’t noise. It's modulated. Regular pulses—like a heartbeat."</p>

    <p>:"Whose heartbeat>? From where?" asked Tallis, frowning.</p>

<p>Lira spun the model to zoom inside Neptune's radius. "From here. Thirteen thousand miles above the geometric enter. Exactly where Neptune’s magnetic field originates—the offset point Voyager first mapped. The line starts there, and rises out to the pole. Not the magnetic pole. The rotational one."</p>

<p>Tallis was silent for a minute, and then asked, "Wait, you said the others run with the sun?"</p>

<p>"They align with the solar wind."</p>

<p>"That kind of alignment shouldn't even *exist*. The magnetic dipole is tilted 47 degrees off the spin axis, but..."

<h3><em>To be continued</em></h3>

it's relative to Neptune's spin. Any field line that stable should twist with the rest, but the rest of them shouldn't be tracking the solar wind.  

**LIRA:**  
Unless something’s forcing it. Forcing the field to chase the sun. Forcing the rogue to hold still.

Something's forcing it. Or something *wants* it to.

**TALLIS:** *(chilling realization dawning)*  
That means if the magnetic and rotational poles *ever* align—

**LIRA:**  
—we get a standing wave. Full harmonic resonance.

**TALLIS:**  
That could channel... what? Energy? Particles?

**LIRA:** *(hesitant)*  
Space-time distortion. If the field line is stable enough, and the energy coupling high enough… we’re not talking about a signal. We’re talking about **a solar-wind powered tunnel**.

**TALLIS:**  
To where?

Lira stares out the observation glass toward the stars.

**LIRA:**  
I don’t think we ask *where*. I think we ask *who*.

**TALLIS:**  
And what happens when they answer?

      This line came to me while crawling through attic insulation and trying not to scream at my house wiring. One rogue wire ran <strong>North-South</strong>, while everything else in the house ran <strong>East-West</strong> — sun-aligned. I muttered the line, and then everything in my novel snapped into place. Suddenly, Neptune’s magnetic field aligned with my dining room junction box. That’s how this works.

      In the attic of our legacy home, I was tracing a rogue circuit to the dining room. After hours of crawling and testing, I found the outlier — a wire running south, hidden and overly long. “All the others run with the sun," I thought, very annoyed.

    <p><strong>I do not shine</strong></p>

    <p>The deep cobalt hues of the panoramic display walls, painted with layered telemetry, had made it easy for Lira to lose track of twenty hours: pulsing auroral bursts, rotational harmonics, magnetic contour models. Data trails hung like frozen lightning bolts. Sitting cross-legged in the data well, she'd been obsessively cross-referencing Voyager legacy logs with Thalassa's live field data.  The hum of analysis loops played like wind through reeds in her mind.</p>

<p>Tallis entered quietly. Grizzled, minimalist, hard to rattle; by the standards of this century, a virtual Luddite. Once he did magnetohydrodynamics. Once, before the promotion to supervisor. He watched her work before speaking.</p>

<p>"You planning on sleeping this cycle?"</p>

<p>Or longer. Voyager was just the first to fly through it. I ran a spectral cross-correlation. That blip? It wasn’t noise. It was a **modulated carrier wave**. Regular pulses—like a heartbeat.</p>

    <p>:"Whose heartbeat>? From where?" asked Tallis, frowning.</p>
