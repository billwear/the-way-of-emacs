21-ish Life Lessons I Learned the Hard Way (So You Can Learn Them the Funny Way)

Let’s be real: adulting is mostly making weird decisions at a stoplight — and realizing too late this isn’t your car.

Life didn’t come with a user guide — just a folded piece of paper covered in hieroglyphics and a mysterious screw you’re pretty sure is important. So here — take these hard-won life lessons from someone who once tried to deep-clean their soul with a Magic Eraser.

You’re welcome.

---

### 1. **Say what you mean.**
Because telepathy is still in beta and your “vibe” isn’t always as clear as you think. If you want help, ask. If you’re confused, say it. If you’re angry, don’t just *aggressively load the dishwasher* and hope someone notices.

No one’s decoding your sighs except your cat. And s/he’s judging you.

---

### 2. **Your brain thinks your media is real.**
So maybe don’t watch 3 hours of apocalyptic news and then wonder why you’re spiral-Googling “how to grow potatoes on a balcony.” Your mind is a sponge. Feed it Bob Ross, not existential dread and cryptocurrency bros.

---

### 3. **Speak clearly. Listen like you’re at a murder mystery dinner.**
Miscommunication is how you end up agreeing to babysit a ferret for two weeks when you thought you were ordering takeout. Use words. Real ones. Ask questions. Clarify. Repeat back.

Especially if ferrets are involved.

---

### 4. **Do what you love, but don’t bet the mortgage on it.**
Make art. Build robots. Collect ceramic frogs. Follow your joy. But don’t assume the universe owes you a six-figure income just because you crocheted a line of emotionally vulnerable llamas.

Passion ≠ paycheck. Still worth it, though.

---

### 5. **Keep it simple.**
Complicated plans are how people end up duct-taped to flagpoles holding a karaoke mic and shouting, “I had a vision!” while everyone else slowly backs away.

Simple means survivable. Simple gets finished. Simple doesn’t require a team of consultants, three whiteboards

---

### 6. **Start small, build weird.**
You don’t need a 10-year plan. You need a to-do list that doesn’t make you cry. Stack little wins. Stack ‘em like Legos. Eventually you’ll look back and realize you accidentally built a spaceship. Or a functioning spice rack. Either way: success.

---

### 7. **Network, but not like a weirdo.**
Don’t schmooze. Just talk to people. Make friends. Offer help. Remember birthdays. Someone you met at a waffle truck in 2012 might one day save your career or lend you a backhoe. Life’s funny like that.

---

### 8. **Be yourself. Especially if “yourself” is a raccoon in a trench coat trying their best.**
Perfect is boring. Weird is memorable. Be the kind of person who’s slightly unhinged but brings snacks and solid Wi-Fi.

Even bent wires conduct electricity. And chaos.

---

### 9. **Build for strength, not speed.**
The hare had abs and a personal brand. The tortoise had emotional stability and a mortgage. Guess who won? (Hint: it wasn’t the one doing burpees on Instagram.)

---

### 10. **Try stuff. Break stuff. Learn stuff.**
Tinker. Hack. Make things work that shouldn’t. Just don’t “see what happens” with things involving electricity, velocity, or wild animals.

Curiosity is great. So is a basic understanding of personal safety.

---

### 11. **Under-promise, over-deliver.**
Say you’ll bring paper plates. Show up with cupcakes, confetti, and a PowerPoint presentation titled *“Why You Are All Magnificent.”*

Now you’re unforgettable *and* statistically the office favorite.

---

### 12. **Divide and conquer.**
Don’t try to fix your life all at once. That’s how you end up organizing your sock drawer at 2 a.m. while crying about taxes and listening to a podcast called *Minimalism for Maximalists.*

Break big stuff into tiny chunks. Reward yourself after each. Snacks encouraged.

---

### 13. **Do one thing well.**
Be the person people call for *that* thing. Doesn’t matter what it is. Could be ghostwriting. Could be potato salad. Just pick a lane and drive it like it owes you rent.

Remember: unicorns got famous for doing *one* thing exceptionally. And it wasn’t multitasking.

---

### 14. **Use what you have.**
Ingenuity beats new gadgets. Duct tape, a shoehorn, and three binder clips can get you through most situations — except maybe emotional intimacy.

Also: if you still own floppy disks, I love you, but it’s time. Let go.

---

### 15. **Use levers, not people.**
People are not productivity tools. They’re not extensions of your will. They’re squishy, complicated creatures who cry at commercials and need breaks.

Use systems. Use automation. Use kindness. Be a decent human. (Optional: provide snacks.)

---

### 16. **Release early, release often.**
Don’t hoard your brilliance. Nobody’s asking for perfection — just *progress.* Put your work out into the world while it’s still wearing metaphorical sweatpants.

Iteration is magic. Hoarding is just fear in a trench coat.

---

### 17. **Distrust all “one true way” claims.**
Especially if they come with a head mic and a subscription fee.

Except pizza. Pizza *is* the one true way. Pineapple on top is a personality test.

---

### 18. **Think ahead, but don’t marry your plans.**
Be flexible. Life is mostly improv with occasional PowerPoint slides. Sometimes the road map catches fire and you just have to grab snacks and follow the ducks.

Pivot. Recalculate. Laugh. Repeat.

---

### 19. **Think big. You’re a cosmic miracle in sweatpants.**
You’re made of star stuff and bad decisions. Dream outrageously. Go weird. Just maybe don’t base your five-year plan on becoming a wizard unless you’ve got a backup trade.

---

### 20. **Reject violence. Embrace the awkward pause.**
You don’t have to win the argument. Just raise one eyebrow, say “interesting,” and walk away like a mysterious monk who knows everyone else is wrong.

Peace is power. Silence is a flex. Drama is overrated.

---

### 21. **Respect the Prime Directive.**
Don’t meddle unless asked. And even then, proceed like you’re holding a baby squirrel and it’s wearing a tiny hat.

But if you *are* in a sci-fi movie? Absolutely ignore it. Beam down. Fall in love with the alien. Redecorate the spaceship.

---

### Final thought:  
Life is a ridiculous choose-your-own-adventure novel written by caffeine and chaos. You will absolutely make mistakes. You will forget people’s names. You will someday cry over a meatball sub.

But you will also make people laugh. You’ll make things. You’ll survive things. You’ll find your people. And when you do? Duct tape them to your metaphorical flagpole and hand them a karaoke mic.

Because this? This is your anthem.
