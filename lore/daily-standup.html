      <p>The daily stand-up in Agile is a glorified status huddle disguised as a ritual of empowerment. Its actual purpose is:</p>

      <p>📍Purpose</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Synchronize the team: Who’s doing what, where the overlap is, and who’s about to break the build.</li>

	<li>Identify blockers early: Not solve them—just throw them on the bonfire so they can be addressed later.</li>

	<li>Maintain visibility: Everyone sees the same board, and nobody gets to vanish into the void for three days claiming “I was working on it.”</li>

	<li>Reinforce team cohesion: Brief, ritualized human contact that reminds everyone they are part of a system, not just a weird code hermit.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is not:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A status report for management.</li>

	<li>A place to explain your life story.</li>

	<li>A therapy circle. (Tempting, but no.)</li>
      </ul>
