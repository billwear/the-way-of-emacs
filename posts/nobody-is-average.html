    <h1>Own Your Defaults: Why the "Average User" Doesn't Exist</h1>
    <p class="date">March 18, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Every piece of technology you use was designed <strong>for someone</strong>—but that someone isn’t you.</p>
    
    <p>It was built for an <strong>average user</strong>, a mythical person who doesn’t actually exist. And like any company that wants to stay in business, the designers behind it needed to balance two things: <strong>making it useful enough to keep people engaged, but also structured in a way that keeps them coming back.</strong></p>
    
    <p>If this sounds familiar, it’s because <strong>medicine works the same way.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>The Problem With "Average" Defaults</h2>
    
    <p>When a doctor prescribes a medication, they don’t tailor it to you <strong>personally</strong> right away. They start with a dosage that works for the "average person"—even though <strong>nobody is truly average.</strong> Some people need more, some less. Some experience side effects. The prescription is <strong>a starting point, not a perfect fit.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Technology, systems, and workflows operate the same way. <strong>The default settings you inherit are designed for a broad, general audience</strong>—which means they’re rarely optimized for you.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Your phone’s home screen was arranged <strong>to be familiar, not necessarily functional.</strong></li>
        <li>Your apps are designed <strong>to be engaging, not necessarily efficient.</strong></li>
        <li>Your work tools come with <strong>default workflows that may not match how you think.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These aren’t bad things—they’re just <strong>starting points.</strong> But most people never move beyond them.</p>
    
    <h2>How I Design My Own Defaults</h2>
    
    <p>Instead of accepting defaults, I build <strong>systems that fit me.</strong> Some are technical, but many are just about <strong>structuring my life intentionally.</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>I structure my day with a template agenda.</strong> Certain tasks are available at certain times—not because I have to do them then, but because that’s when they make the most sense. It’s not a rigid schedule, just a <strong>guide</strong> to help me make better decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>I use friction as a natural priority filter.</strong> Most tasks repeat daily until they’re done. The longer I ignore one, the more it nags me. That <strong>annoyance turns into urgency</strong>—eventually, it outweighs the inertia, and I do it.</li>
        <li><strong>I try to check my agenda when I change contexts.</strong> When I shift from one activity to another, I look at the list. Instead of forcing productivity, I let my system <strong>surface the right task at the right time.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Even the missing pieces start to nag me.</strong> If I keep forgetting to do something in a certain context—like winding down before bed—eventually, the context itself starts feeling incomplete. That friction builds until I finally treat it like a real priority.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why I Design My Defaults This Way</h2>
    
    <p>I don’t structure things this way because it’s the <em>best</em> method—I do it because it’s the most effective for <strong>how my attention and judgment actually work.</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>My attention drifts toward what’s unresolved.</strong> If something stays on my list long enough, it naturally starts pulling focus. Instead of fighting this tendency, I use it.</li>
        <li><strong>I don’t want to force decisions constantly.</strong> Instead of waking up and deciding <em>what</em> to do, I want a system that makes the decision <em>obvious</em> when the time comes.</li>
        <li><strong>I work better with natural pressure than artificial urgency.</strong> Deadlines are fine, but what really works for me is <strong>building up just enough internal friction that the right task becomes inevitable.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This isn’t about being perfectly efficient—it’s about <strong>owning how my mind works and designing a system that plays to its strengths.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Three Small Default Shifts That Make a Big Difference</h2>
    
    <p><strong>📌 Social Media: Make It Work for You, Not Against You</strong></p>
    <p>If social media is useful but overwhelming, try setting a <strong>default limit</strong> instead of quitting cold turkey. Example: <strong>Move social apps off your home screen</strong> or <strong>schedule specific times to check them.</strong> The goal isn’t restriction—it’s reclaiming control.</p>
    
    <p><strong>🛠 Overcoming Drudgery: Make Momentum Easy</strong></p>
    <p>Hate starting hard tasks? Change the default. Instead of “I need to finish this,” try <strong>“I just need to start.”</strong> Sometimes, <strong>committing to two minutes</strong> is all it takes to break resistance. Momentum will take care of the rest.</p>
    
    <p><strong>💬 Difficult Conversations: Change the Starting Point</strong></p>
    <p>Tough conversations often default to avoidance or confrontation. Try shifting the <strong>default assumption</strong>—instead of thinking “This is going to be awful,” start with <strong>“What’s the simplest way to make this constructive?”</strong> Approach it as problem-solving, not conflict.</p>
    
    <h2>Always Own Your Path</h2>
    
    <p>Defaults exist for a reason. In medicine, they help doctors make decisions before they know you personally. In technology, they make things functional for the widest range of people.</p>
    
    <p>But <strong>you aren’t average.</strong></p>
    
    <p>If you don’t set your own defaults, you’ll always be using someone else’s.</p>
    
    <p>So, what’s one default you could <strong>take control of today?</strong></p>
