    <h1>Own your defaults: Why the "average user" doesn't exist</h1>
    <p class="date">March 18, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Every piece of technology you use was designed for someone — but that someone isn’t you.</p>
    
    <p>It was built for an average user, a mythical person who doesn’t actually exist. And like any company that wants to stay in business, the designers behind it needed to balance two things: making it useful enough to keep people engaged, but also structured in a way that keeps them coming back.</p>
    
    <p>If this sounds familiar, it’s because medicine works the same way.</p>
    
    <h2>The problem With average defaults</h2>
    
    <p>When a doctor prescribes a medication, they don’t tailor it to you personally right away. They start with a dosage that works for the "average person" — even though nobody is truly average. Some people need more, some less. Some experience side effects. The prescription is a starting point, not a perfect fit.</p>
    
    <p>Technology, systems, and workflows operate the same way. The default settings you inherit are designed for a broad, general audience — which means they’re rarely optimized for you.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Your phone’s home screen was arranged to be familiar, but not necessarily functional.</li>
        <li>Your apps are designed to be engaging, but not necessarily efficient.</li>
        <li>Your work tools come with default workflows that may not match how you think.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These aren’t bad things — they’re just starting points. Sadly, most people never move beyond them.</p>
    
    <h2>How I design my own defaults</h2>
    
    <p>Instead of accepting defaults, I try to build systems that fit me. Some are technical, but many are just about structuring my life intentionally, around my own mental habits.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>I structure my day with a template agenda. Certain tasks are available at certain times—not because I have to do them then, but because that’s when they make the most sense. It’s not a rigid schedule, just a guide to help me make better decisions.</li>
        <li>I use friction as a natural priority filter. Most tasks repeat daily until they’re done. The longer I ignore one, the more it nags me. That annoyance turns into urgency — eventually, it outweighs the inertia, and I do it.</li>
        <li>I try to check my agenda when I change contexts. When I shift from one space or activity to another, I look at the list. Instead of forcing productivity, I let my system surface the right task at the right time.</li>
        <li>Even the missing pieces start to nag me. If I keep forgetting to do something in a certain context — like winding down before bed — eventually, the context itself starts feeling incomplete. That friction builds until I finally treat it like a real priority.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why I design my defaults this way</h2>
    
    <p>I don’t structure things this way because it’s the <em>best</em> method — I do it because it’s the most effective for how my attention and judgment actually work.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>My attention drifts toward what’s unresolved. If something stays on my list long enough, it naturally starts pulling focus. Instead of fighting this tendency, I use it.</li>
        <li>I don’t want to force decisions constantly. Instead of waking up and deciding <em>what</em> to do, I want a system that makes the decision <em>obvious</em> when the time comes.</li>
        <li>I work better with natural pressure than artificial urgency. Deadlines are fine, but what really works for me is building up just enough internal friction that the right task becomes inevitable.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This isn’t about being perfectly efficient — it’s about learning how my mind works and designing a system that plays to its strengths <em>and</em> weaknesses.</p>
    
    <h2>Three small default shifts that make a big difference</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Make social media work <em>for</em> you</strong>: If social media is useful but overwhelming, try setting some default limits. Move social apps off your home screen, schedule specific times to check them, or set a time limit to doomscroll. The goal isn’t restriction, it’s reclaiming control.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Make momentum easy</strong>: Hate starting hard tasks? Change the default. Instead of “I need to finish this,” try “I just need to start.” Sometimes, committing to two minutes is all it takes to break resistance. Momentum will take care of the rest.</p>
    
    <p><strong>💬 Difficult Conversations: Change the Starting Point</strong></p>
    <p>Tough conversations often default to avoidance or confrontation. Try shifting the <strong>default assumption</strong>—instead of thinking “This is going to be awful,” start with <strong>“What’s the simplest way to make this constructive?”</strong> Approach it as problem-solving, not conflict.</p>
    
    <h2>Always Own Your Path</h2>
    
    <p>Defaults exist for a reason. In medicine, they help doctors make decisions before they know you personally. In technology, they make things functional for the widest range of people.</p>
    
    <p>But <strong>you aren’t average.</strong></p>
    
    <p>If you don’t set your own defaults, you’ll always be using someone else’s.</p>
    
    <p>So, what’s one default you could <strong>take control of today?</strong></p>
