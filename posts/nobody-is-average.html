    <h1>Own your defaults<br/>Why the "average user" doesn't exist</h1>
    <p class="date">March 18, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Every piece of technology you use, from the #2 pencil to a supercomputer, was designed for someone â€” but that someone isnâ€™t you.</p>
    
    <p>It was built for an average user, a mythical person who doesnâ€™t actually exist. Any company that wants to stay in business has to balance two things: making it useful enough to keep people engaged, but also structured in a way that keeps them coming back.</p>

    <p>As <a href="https://calnewport.com/building-a-career-that-matters/">Cal Newport observes</a>, the best way to do this is to develop rare and valuable products.  One of the proudest days of my life was the day I went to work for Hewlett-Packard and got my first name badge.  This was when Bill and Dave were still around and partially involved.  For 62 years, from 1938 until 2000, they built a reliable, repeatable, billion-dollar business on one simple principle by finding and filling niches -- crowded or not -- with rare tools that did really valuable things nobody else ever offered.  As long as they did that, they were an outstanding standout.</p>
    
    <p>Bill Hewlett almost went into medicine instead of Electrical Engineering.  I can't help but think that today's healthcare would be very different if he had.</p>
    
    <h2>The problem with average defaults</h2>
    
    <p>Speaking of medicine, that's someplace where average reigns.  When a doctor prescribes a medication, they donâ€™t tailor it to you personally right away. They start with a dosage that works for the "average person" â€” even though nobody is truly average. Some people need more, some less. Some experience side effects. The prescription is a starting point, not a perfect fit.</p>
    
    <p>Technology, systems, and workflows operate the same way. The default settings you inherit are designed for a broad, general audience â€” which means theyâ€™re rarely optimized for you.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Your phoneâ€™s home screen was arranged to be familiar, but not necessarily functional.</li>
        <li>Your apps are designed to be engaging, but not necessarily efficient.</li>
        <li>Your work tools come with default workflows that may not match how you think.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These arenâ€™t necessarily bad things â€” theyâ€™re just starting points. Sadly, most people never move beyond them.</p>
    
    <h2>How I design my own defaults</h2>
    
    <p>Instead of accepting defaults, I try to build systems that fit me. Some are technical, but many are just about structuring my life intentionally, around my own mental habits.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>I structure my day with a template agenda. Certain tasks are available at certain times â€” not because I have to do them <em>at that particular</em> time, but because thatâ€™s when they make the most sense. Itâ€™s not a rigid schedule, just a guide to help me make better decisions.</li>
        <li>I use friction as a natural priority filter. Most tasks repeat daily until theyâ€™re done. The longer I ignore one, the more it nags me. That annoyance turns into urgency â€” eventually, it outweighs the inertia, and I do it.</li>
        <li>I try to check my agenda when I change contexts. When I shift from one space or activity to another, I look at the list. Instead of forcing productivity, I let my system surface the right task at the right time.</li>
        <li>Even the missing pieces start to nag me. If I keep forgetting to do something in a certain context â€” like winding down before bed â€” eventually, the context itself starts feeling incomplete. That friction builds until I finally treat it like a real priority.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why I design my defaults this way</h2>
    
    <p>I donâ€™t structure things this way because itâ€™s the <em>best</em> method â€” I do it because itâ€™s most effective for how my attention and judgment actually work.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>My attention drifts toward whatâ€™s unresolved. If something stays on my list long enough, it naturally starts pulling focus. Instead of fighting this tendency (a fight I gave up long ago), I just use it.</li>
        <li>I donâ€™t want to force decisions constantly. Instead of waking up and deciding <em>what</em> to do, I want a system that makes the decision <em>obvious</em> when the time comes.</li>
        <li>I work better with natural pressure than artificial urgency. Deadlines are fine, but what really works for me is building up just enough internal friction that the right task becomes inevitable.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is really just learning how my mind works and designing a system that plays to its strengths <em>and</em> weaknesses.</p>
    
     <p><strong>ðŸ“Œ Social media: Make it a tool, not a trap</strong></p>
    <p>Want to stay connected without getting sucked into a doomscroll vortex? <strong>Remove social apps from your home screen</strong> and make them just inconvenient enough to force a conscious decision. Even better: <strong>set a browser bookmark for the one person or group that actually adds value.</strong> Everything else? Make it work to get your attention.</p>
    
    <p><strong>ðŸ›  Overcoming drudgery: The 2-minute mind hack</strong></p>
    <p>Hate starting hard tasks? Trick yourself. Instead of thinking, "I have to do this," say: <strong>"Iâ€™ll do two minutes and quit if I want to."</strong> Nine times out of ten, you wonâ€™t quit â€” because starting is the hardest part. Once youâ€™re moving, momentum takes care of the rest.</p>
    
    <p><strong>ðŸ’¬ Difficult conversations: Flip the script</strong></p>
    <p>Most people default to avoidance or confrontation. Try this: Instead of thinking, <strong>"How do I win this?"</strong> ask: <strong>"How do I make it easier for both of us to walk away feeling better?"</strong> Frame it as problem-solving, not a battle or competition, and the whole conversation shifts.</p>
 
    <h2>Always own your path</h2>
    
    <p>Defaults exist for a reason. In medicine, they help doctors make decisions before they know you personally. In technology, they make things functional for the widest range of people.</p>
    
    <p>But <strong>you arenâ€™t average,</strong> and in at least one way, <em>everybody</em> is above average</em>.  Find it, bottle it, share it.  Your life will be better for it.</p>
    
    <p>If you donâ€™t set your own defaults, youâ€™ll always be using someone elseâ€™s.</p>
