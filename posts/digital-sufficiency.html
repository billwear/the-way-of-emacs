    <h1>Digital sufficiency: The right amount of technology</h1>
    <p class="date">March 11, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Technology should serve us, not the other way around. But in an era where smartphones are engineered for endless distraction, it’s easy to slip into passive consumption. 
        The question isn’t <em>how little</em> tech we can use — it’s how to use just the right amount <em>for you</em>.</p>
    
    <p>I run Emacs on my phone (not recommended, unless you either like Emacs or want to learn it). My Android launcher? It’s a command line interface (Yantra Launcher). 
        No icons, no swipe-to-scroll dopamine loops. If I want to open an app, I type its name. This setup forces <em>intentionality</em>. 
        If I’m picking up my phone, it’s because I need to do something, not because I’m aimlessly scrolling.</p>
    
    <h2>Minimalism vs. sufficiency</h2>
    <p>People talk a lot about <strong>digital minimalism</strong>, the idea of stripping away everything unnecessary. But minimalism can be extreme, 
    reducing tech to the point where it hinders productivity instead of helping. Sufficiency is different. It’s about having exactly what you need: 
        no more, no less. Just enough to be effective, without excess noise.</p>
    
    <p>It's more about deliberate versus default use.  Most people use technology the way it’s handed to them: default settings, preloaded apps, infinite notifications. 
        But those defaults weren’t designed for your benefit; they were designed to keep you engaged, addicted, and profitable to someone else.</p>
    
    <p>Running Emacs on my phone isn’t about being hardcore. It’s about shaping my environment to match how <em>I, myself,</em> want to think and work. 
        A launcher that makes me type means I have to know what I’m going to do before I do it. That one-second barrier is enough to make mindless browsing 
        feel like effort, and for me (at least) that’s the point.</p>
    
    <h2>Finding your own digital sufficiency</h2>

    <p>This balance point is unique to everyone.  As a counter-point, consider one of my closest friends.  They have several health issues that make it more difficult for them to get out
        and visit all the time.  They not homebound, but they gravitate toward comfort for very good physical reasons.</p>

    <p>Still, my friend has a vibrant social life, because of social media.  They are able to be actively engaged in many other people's lives through a large iPad that helps with 
        their accessibility issues.  For them, at least, turning off social media would <em>not be sufficient for them,</em> because of their situation.  Rather, <em>because of</em> 
        social media, they are able to have many friends, with whom they frequently interact, and often, in the middle of the night, when those friends are down or stuck in the hospital,
        my friend is right there to listen and cheer them up.  So social media is perfect for them.</p>
    
    <p>So you don’t have to switch to a command-line launcher or run Emacs on your phone (again, <em>not recommended</em>) to apply this thinking. But take a moment to ask: 
        Is my tech serving me, or am I serving it?</p>
    
    <p>Here are some potential ways to reclaim control:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn off non-essential notifications.</li>
        <li>Remove apps that don’t provide real value.  This can sometimes help with battery life, too.</li>
        <li>Use tools that require deliberate action instead of passive scrolling, like actually reading the weather forecast from a reliable, ad-free source.</li>
        <li>Set up your environment to encourage focus and intentional use.  At the very least, put those doomscrollers on a second or third screen, so they're that much further away.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It's not about rejecting technology and becoming a luddite.  It’s about using technology to stay effective and <em>in control of your time and your life.</em>
        What would that look like for you?</p>
