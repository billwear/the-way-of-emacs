    <h1>Digital sufficiency: The right amount of technology</h1>
    <p class="date">March 11, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Technology should serve us, but with smartphones engineered for distraction, it’s easy to become a passive consumption. 
        The question really isn’t <em>how little</em> tech we can use — it’s how to use the right amount <em>for you</em>.</p>
    
    <p>I run Emacs on my phone (not recommended, unless you either like Emacs or want to learn it). My Android launcher? It’s a command line interface (Yantra Launcher). 
        No icons, no swipe-to-scroll dopamine loops. I have to type "launch name" to open an app, which enforces <em>intentionality</em>. 
        If I’m picking up my phone, it’s because I need to do something, not for aimless scrolling.</p>
    
    <h2>Minimalism vs. sufficiency</h2>
    <p>People talk a lot about <strong>digital minimalism</strong>, the idea of stripping away everything unnecessary. Minimalism can be extreme, 
    reducing tech to the point where it actually hinders productivity. Sufficiency means having exactly what you need: 
        no more, no less. Just enough to be effective, without noise or distraction.</p>
    
    <p>It's more about <em>deliberate</em> versus <em>default</em> use.  Many use technology the way it’s handed to them: default settings, preloaded apps, infinite notifications. 
        Those defaults weren’t designed for your benefit; they were designed to keep you engaged, addicted, and profitable to someone else.</p>
    
    <p>Running Emacs on my phone shapes my environment to the way <em>I, myself,</em> want to think and work. 
        A launcher that makes me type means I have to know what I’m going to do before I do it. That one-second barrier is enough to make mindless browsing 
        feel like effort, and for me (at least) that’s the point.</p>
    
    <h2>Finding your own digital sufficiency</h2>

    <p> Everyone's different in this respect. Consider a close friends with several health issues that make life more difficult.  
        They're not homebound, but they gravitate toward comfort for very good reasons.</p>

    <p>Still, my friend has a vibrant social life, because of social media.  They are actively engaged in many other people's lives, through a large iPad that helps with 
        their accessibility issues.  Lacking social media would be <em>insufficient</em> because of their situation.</p> 
    <p>Because of social media, they enjoy a wide circle of friends, with whom they frequently interact.  My friend's condition also causes them to sleep at odd hours.  Often, in the 
        middle of the night, when someone in that circle is depressed, sleepless,  or stuck in the hospital, my friend is right there to listen and cheer them up.  
        Social media is perfect for them.</p>
    
    <p>You don’t have to switch to a command-line launcher or run Emacs on your phone (again, <em>not recommended</em>) to apply this thinking. But take a moment to ask: 
        Is my tech serving me, or am I serving it?</p>
    
    <p>Here are some potential ways to reclaim control:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn off non-essential notifications.  When you find yourself feeling annoyed at an app that often pings you, shut it up.</li>
        <li>Remove apps that don’t provide real value.  This can sometimes save battery life, too.</li>
        <li>Use tools that require deliberate action instead of passive scrolling, like actually reading the weather forecast from a reliable, ad-free source.</li>
        <li>Set up your environment to encourage focus and intentional use.  At the very least, put those doomscrollers on a second or third screen, so they're that much further away.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It's not about rejecting technology and becoming a luddite.  It’s about using technology to stay effective and <em>in control of your time and your life.</em>
        What would that look like for you?</p>
