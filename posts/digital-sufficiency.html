    <h1>Digital Sufficiency: The Right Amount of Technology</h1>
    <p class="date">March 11, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Technology should serve us, not the other way around. But in an era where smartphones are engineered for endless distraction, it’s easy to slip into passive consumption. The question isn’t **how little** tech we can use—it’s how to use just the right amount.</p>
    
    <p>I run Emacs on my phone. My Android launcher? It’s a command line interface (Yantra Launcher). No icons, no swipe-to-scroll dopamine loops. If I want to open an app, I type its name. This setup forces **intentionality**—if I’m picking up my phone, it’s because I need to do something, not because I’m aimlessly scrolling.</p>
    
    <h2>Minimalism vs. Sufficiency</h2>
    <p>People talk a lot about **digital minimalism**, the idea of stripping away everything unnecessary. But minimalism can be extreme—reducing tech to the point where it **hinders productivity instead of helping**. Sufficiency is different. It’s about having exactly what you need, no more, no less. Just enough tools to be effective, without the excess noise.</p>
    
    <h2>Deliberate Use vs. Default Use</h2>
    <p>Most people use technology the way it’s handed to them—default settings, preloaded apps, infinite notifications. But those defaults weren’t designed for your benefit; they were designed to keep you **engaged, addicted, and profitable** to someone else.</p>
    
    <p>Running Emacs on my phone isn’t about being hardcore. It’s about shaping my environment to match how I want to think and work. A launcher that makes me type means I have to **know what I’m doing before I do it**. That one-second barrier is enough to make mindless browsing feel like effort—and that’s the point.</p>
    
    <h2>Finding Your Own Digital Sufficiency</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to switch to a command-line launcher or run Emacs on your phone to apply this thinking. But take a moment to ask: **Is my tech serving me, or am I serving it?**</p>
    
    <p>Some ways to reclaim control:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn off non-essential notifications.</li>
        <li>Remove apps that don’t provide real value.</li>
        <li>Use tools that require **deliberate action** instead of passive scrolling.</li>
        <li>Set up your environment to encourage **focus and intentional use**.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Digital sufficiency isn’t about rejecting technology—it’s about using **just the right amount** to stay effective and in control. What would that look like for you?</p>
