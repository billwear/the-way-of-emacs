    <h1>Digital Sufficiency: The Right Amount of Technology</h1>
    <p class="date">March 11, 2025</p>
    
   <p>Technology should serve us, but with
smartphones engineered for distraction, it’s
easy to become a passive consumer. Even so, the question really isn’t <em>how little</em> tech we can use — it’s "How can you use the right amount <em>for you</em>?"</p>
    
    <p>I run Emacs on my phone (not
recommended, unless you like Emacs or want to
learn it). My phone is loaded with a command
line interface (Yantra Launcher). No icons, no swipe-to-scroll dopamine loops. I have to type "launch name" to open an  app, which enforces <em>intentionality</em>. If I’m picking up my phone, it’s because I need to do something, not for aimless scrolling.</p>
    
   <h2>Minimalism vs. sufficiency</h2>

    <p>People talk a lot about <strong>digital minimalism</strong>, the idea of stripping away everything unnecessary. Minimalism can be extreme, reducing tech to the point where it actually hinders productivity. Sufficiency means having exactly what you need: no more, no less. Just enough to be effective, without noise or distraction.</p>
    <p>It's more about <em>deliberate</em>
versus <em>default</em> use.  Many accept
technology the way it’s handed to them:
many presets, preloaded apps, infinite
notifications. Those defaults weren’t designed for your benefit; they were designed to keep you engaged, addicted, and profitable to someone else.</p>
    <p>Running Emacs on my phone isn’t about being hardcore. It’s about shaping my environment to match how I want to think and work. A launcher that makes me type means I have to know what I’m doing before I do it. That one-second barrier is enough to make mindless browsing feel like effort—and that’s the point.</p>
    
   <h2>Finding your own digital sufficiency</h2>
    <p>Everyone's different in this respect.
Consider a close friend with several health
issues that make life more difficult.       They're not homebound, but they gravitate toward comfort for very good reasons.</p>
    <p>Still, my friend has a vibrant social
life because of social media. They are
actively engaged with many othr people,
through a large iPad that helps with their accessibility issues.  Lacking social media would be <em>insufficient</em> because of their situation.</p>
    <p>They enjoy a wide circle of friends
with whom they frequently interact.  My
friend's condition also causes them to sleep
at odd hours.  Often, in the middle of the night, when someone in that circle is depressed, sleepless, or stuck in the hospital, my friend is right there to listen and cheer them up. Social media is perfect for them.</p>
 <p>You don’t have to switch to a
command-line launcher or run Emacs on your
phone (again, <em>not recommended</em>) to
apply this thinking. You should absolutely         not copy someone else's setup unless it really speaks to you. But take a moment to
ask: Is tech serving me, or am I serving
it?</p>
 <p>Here are some potential ways to reclaim  control:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn off non-essential
notifications.  When you find yourself feeling annoyed at an app that often pings you, shut it up.</li>
        <li>Remove apps that don’t provide
real value.  This can sometimes save battery
life, too.</li>
        <li>Use tools that require deliberate
action instead of passive scrolling, like
actually reading the weather forecast from a
reliable, ad-free source.</li>
        <li>Set up your environment to
encourage focus and intentional use. At the
very least, put those doomscrollers on a
second or third screen, so they're that much
further away.</li>

 <p>Don't indiscriminately reject technology.  Instead, actively choose the technology that keeps you effective and in control of your time and your life. What would that look like for you?</p>
