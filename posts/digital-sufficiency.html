    <h1>Digital sufficiency<br/>The right amount of technology</h1>
    <p class="date">March 11, 2025</p>
    
<p>Smartphones are built to steal your time.</p>
<p>Pick one up, and suddenly you’re 45 minutes deep into nothing. That’s by design. But tech’s supposed to serve <em>you</em>, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Still, this isn’t about ditching devices. The real question is: What’s the right amount of tech <em>for you</em>?</p>

<p>I run Emacs on my phone. Would I recommend it? Not unless you really like Emacs or want to learn it. My launcher is all command line — no icons, no infinite scroll, no tap-and-drip dopamine hits. If I want an app, I type `launch {app-name}`. That one-second pause is just enough to make me think: <em>Do I actually need this right now?*</em>

<p>This isn't minimalism, it’s sufficiency.</p>

<p>Minimalism gets all the buzz — cut everything, use nothing, be austere. But taken too far, it starts to hurt more than help. Sufficiency is different. It means having just enough to get the job done, with nothing getting in your way. No clutter. No drag.</p>

<p>Most people live on tech defaults: preset apps; constant pings; engagement loops engineered to keep you hooked. Those defaults weren’t made for your benefit — they were made for ad revenue.</p>

<p>Running Emacs on my phone sounds nuts, but it works for me. My system is built for intention. I don’t open apps unless I know why. That tiny barrier keeps me from falling into the void.</p>

<h2>Sufficiency is personal.</h2>
<p>What works for me might not work for you.</p>

<p>A close friend of mine lives with chronic health issues. They’re not stuck in bed, but daily life takes a toll. Social media — on a big iPad — helps them stay connected. They’ve got a vibrant network of real friends, and they’re often the one showing up at 3AM when someone’s hurting. For them, social media isn’t noise. It’s lifeline.</p>

<p>You probably don’t need a terminal launcher or Emacs on your phone. You probably don't <em>need</em> to rely on social media for your human interaction. You don’t need anyone else’s setup.  
You just need to ask: <em>Is my tech helping me live the way I want to live?</em></p>

<p>Here are a few ways to start tilting the balance:</p>

    <ul>
<li>Kill notifications that don’t matter. If it’s annoying, it’s probably unnecessary.</li>
<li>Delete apps that suck your time without giving anything back.</li>
<li>Replace passive scroll with active use — check the forecast instead of doomscrolling.</li>
<li>Restructure your screens. Put temptation a few swipes away.</li>
<li>Choose your tools. Don’t just accept them.</li>
</ul>

    <p>You don’t need less tech. You need the <em>right</em> tech.  Just enough to stay focused, clear, and in control.</p>

<p>What does that look like for you?</p>
