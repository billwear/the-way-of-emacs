    <h1>The Way of Emacs</h1>
    <p class="date">March 4, 2025</p>
    
<p>Life gives us friction.  We have to push back, but often we don't.  I feel that's a mistake that gets us deep into places and situations that we'd rather not endure.  That means there are at least two problems here: getting out of discomfort, and not getting into it to begin with.</p>

<p>One way to at least <em>start</em> to solve both problems is to change your defaults.  On a new phone, not everything is set the way you like it.  Annoyance builds up until you change things so they suit you. Somehow, though, we won't do that with life when it matters most.</p>

<p>Maybe things will get better.  Maybe something will come along and rescue me from this predicament.  Maybe I'll stumble onto something.  If these kinds of things never happened, it would be easy to say, "Get real, self," and move on -- but they do happen sometimes.  The problem is that waiting on them is passive, not active.</p>

<p>If you keep thinking about it, whether in your head, or in your journal, or with an AI buddy, or with a friend, you will probably find some stability.  You may not find a way out, but you'll probably find some peaceful way to live a better life, even in spite of the issues that bother you.  More often than not, though, you can find a better way to do things that removes the old situation from your life.</p>

<p>The core ideas here:</p>

    <ul>
<li>You can't make a start until you embrace honesty.  Being completely honest with others, <em>and</em> with yourself, will change your life from the very first day you make a commitment to do so.</li>
<li>You also have to give up your addiction to sky-magic.  Call it what you will: probabilities, luck, a quirk of fate, prayer, or God; the bottom line is that yes, sometimes sky-magic happens, but it's probably not helpful to wait for it.</li>
<li>You have to pay attention.  Some people call this mindfulness, but that often carries religious or mystical overtones that don't actually help.  Just stay focused on what's around you and how you feel about it.</li>
<li>There's something in your life you'd rather be doing.  Find a way to turn that into a career in some way.  Make it profitable if you can by delivering rare and valuable results with it.</li>
<li>Keep things simple.  Don't overcomplicate your life or use tools because they're "neat" or "fun" unless they provide real value.  Don't clutter your life with too many events, too many commitments, or too much stuff.  It draws you away from what matters.</li>
    </ul>

<p>There are quite a few more core ideas, and I'll talk about them as I go, but that's more than enough to start.  So, for me at least this is The Way of Emacs, which I'm finding is a better way to live.</p>
