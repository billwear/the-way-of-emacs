    <h1>Debugging your life: Why your workflow fails (and how to fix it)</h1>
    <p class="date">March 25, 2025</p>
  

<p>Last time, we talked about **owning your defaults**—ditching the prepackaged settings and workflows designed for some mythical "average user" and replacing them with something that actually fits your brain. But here’s the thing: **even when you do that, your systems will still break.** </p>

<p>Not because you’re lazy. Not because you’re undisciplined. But because **workflows aren’t perfect from the start.** They need **debugging** just like any piece of software.</p>

<h2>Stop Blaming Yourself, Start Debugging</h2>

<p>Most people think a failed system means **they failed.** That’s nonsense. It just means something about your environment, your habits, or your expectations **wasn’t quite right.** Instead of scrapping everything and flailing around for a new miracle system, do what a good engineer would do:</p>

  <ul>
<li>**Identify the failure point.** Where does your system fall apart? When do you start ignoring it?</li>
<li>**Change ONE thing at a time.** Not five. Not three. ONE.</li>
<li>**Test the fix.** Give it a few days. If it helps, keep it. If not, roll it back and try another small tweak.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Most people fail because they throw the whole system away and start over from scratch, over and over, without ever learning what actually worked. **Stop doing that.**</p>  

<h2>The 3 Biggest Reasons Workflows Fail</h2>

<h3>1. You Designed It for the “Best You,” Not the Real You</h3>  
<p>A lot of systems work **in theory.** But theory-you is focused, disciplined, and never gets distracted. **Real-you is tired by 3 PM and sometimes wants a sandwich more than productivity.**</p>  

<p>📌 **Fix It:** Build around your **actual** habits, not your fantasy self. If you never check your agenda in the morning, stop pretending you will. Instead, put the most urgent task **where you’ll see it first**—sticky note, phone lock screen, whatever works.</p>

<h3>2. Hidden Friction Kills Momentum</h3>  
<p>A system can be **technically perfect** and still suck to use. If **one part of it feels annoying, slow, or inconvenient**, you’ll start avoiding it. And once you start skipping it, the whole thing crumbles.</p>

<p>📌 **Fix It:** Identify the **one** piece of your workflow that causes the most resistance. Change just that. **Move a button, automate a step, simplify a template.** That one tweak could make everything else fall into place.</p>

<h3>3. No Feedback = No Fixes</h3>
<p>If your system isn’t **telling you when it’s failing**, you won’t fix it. You’ll just assume you’re bad at it and quit.</p>

<p>📌 **Fix It:** Make failures visible. **Track skipped tasks, abandoned notes, or ignored reminders.** If you keep ignoring something, **that’s a system failure, not a personal one.** Adjust accordingly.</p>

<h2>Just. Change. One. Thing. At. A. Time.</h2>  

<p>I’m going to say it again, because **this is where everyone screws up.**</p>

<p>When your system isn’t working, you will be tempted to:</p>

  <ul>
<li>🚫 **Overhaul everything at once** (BAD)</li>
<li>🚫 **Add a bunch of new rules and tools** (WORSE)</li>
<li>🚫 **Give up and start from scratch** (DISASTROUS)</li>
</ul>

  <p>**DO NOT DO THIS.**</p>  

<p>Instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ **Find ONE failure point.**</li>
<li>✅ **Make ONE small change.**</li>  
<li>✅ **Test it for a few days.**</li>  
<li>✅ **Keep what works. Throw out what doesn’t.**</li> 
</ul>
<p>This is how real improvement happens. **Not through massive overhauls, but through tiny, intentional tweaks that add up over time.**</p>

<p>**Your workflow isn’t broken. It’s just unfinished. Debug it.**</p>
