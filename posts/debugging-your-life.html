# Debugging Your Systems: Why Your Workflow Fails (and How to Fix It)  

Last time, we talked about **owning your defaults**—ditching the prepackaged settings and workflows designed for some mythical "average user" and replacing them with something that actually fits your brain. But here’s the thing: **even when you do that, your systems will still break.**  

Not because you’re lazy. Not because you’re undisciplined. But because **workflows aren’t perfect from the start.** They need **debugging** just like any piece of software.  

## Stop Blaming Yourself, Start Debugging  

Most people think a failed system means **they failed.** That’s nonsense. It just means something about your environment, your habits, or your expectations **wasn’t quite right.** Instead of scrapping everything and flailing around for a new miracle system, do what a good engineer would do:  

- **Identify the failure point.** Where does your system fall apart? When do you start ignoring it?  
- **Change ONE thing at a time.** Not five. Not three. ONE.  
- **Test the fix.** Give it a few days. If it helps, keep it. If not, roll it back and try another small tweak.  

Most people fail because they throw the whole system away and start over from scratch, over and over, without ever learning what actually worked. **Stop doing that.**  

## The 3 Biggest Reasons Workflows Fail  

### 1. You Designed It for the “Best You,” Not the Real You  
A lot of systems work **in theory.** But theory-you is focused, disciplined, and never gets distracted. **Real-you is tired by 3 PM and sometimes wants a sandwich more than productivity.**  

📌 **Fix It:** Build around your **actual** habits, not your fantasy self. If you never check your agenda in the morning, stop pretending you will. Instead, put the most urgent task **where you’ll see it first**—sticky note, phone lock screen, whatever works.  

### 2. Hidden Friction Kills Momentum  
A system can be **technically perfect** and still suck to use. If **one part of it feels annoying, slow, or inconvenient**, you’ll start avoiding it. And once you start skipping it, the whole thing crumbles.  

📌 **Fix It:** Identify the **one** piece of your workflow that causes the most resistance. Change just that. **Move a button, automate a step, simplify a template.** That one tweak could make everything else fall into place.  

### 3. No Feedback = No Fixes  
If your system isn’t **telling you when it’s failing**, you won’t fix it. You’ll just assume you’re bad at it and quit.  

📌 **Fix It:** Make failures visible. **Track skipped tasks, abandoned notes, or ignored reminders.** If you keep ignoring something, **that’s a system failure, not a personal one.** Adjust accordingly.  

## Just. Change. One. Thing. At. A. Time.  

I’m going to say it again, because **this is where everyone screws up.**  

When your system isn’t working, you will be tempted to:  

🚫 **Overhaul everything at once** (BAD)  
🚫 **Add a bunch of new rules and tools** (WORSE)  
🚫 **Give up and start from scratch** (DISASTROUS)  

**DO NOT DO THIS.**  

Instead:  

✅ **Find ONE failure point.**  
✅ **Make ONE small change.**  
✅ **Test it for a few days.**  
✅ **Keep what works. Throw out what doesn’t.**  

This is how real improvement happens. **Not through massive overhauls, but through tiny, intentional tweaks that add up over time.**  

**Your workflow isn’t broken. It’s just unfinished. Debug it.**
