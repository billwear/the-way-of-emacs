    <h1>Stacking wins:<br/>How small fixes turn into massive gains</h1>
    <p class="date">April 1, 2025</p>

<p>Last time, <a href="https://the-way-of-emacs.com/posts/debugging-your-life.html">I said it straight</a>: <strong></strong>just. change. one. thing. at. a. time.</strong> 
    Why? Because trying to fix everything at once is like juggling chainsaws â€” itâ€™s loud, itâ€™s flashy, and odds are youâ€™re gonna bleed.</p>

<p>But once you've stopped the bleeding and got your system breathing again, what next? How do you go from <em>not broken</em> to <em>actually working</em>?</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the secret: <strong>stack small wins</strong>.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t need a life overhaul. You need a winning streak â€” built one tiny win at a time.</p>

<p>Look around. The Great Wall. The pyramids. Mayan temples still standing after a thousand years. They didnâ€™t have excavators or automation. Just patience, grit, and one brick at a time.</p>
    
<p>We struggle to understand that because weâ€™ve been trained to chase scale and speed. But those ancient builders knew something weâ€™ve forgotten: <em>the long game wins</em>.</p>

<h2>Momentum and impulse both move you, but only one helps</h2>

<p>People think progress means a bold leap. Thatâ€™s true â€” if your foundation is rock solid. Most arenâ€™t.</p>

<p>Try to leap when you're off balance and you'll just fall harder.</p>

<p>Think about pushing a skateboard. Youâ€™re rolling smooth, giving the occasional kick to stay moving. Now picture a guy on a motorcycle lassoing you and gunning it.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t fly <em>forward</em>. You fly <em>off</em>. Because your system wasnâ€™t built for that impulse. You werenâ€™t ready.</p>

<p>Real progress doesnâ€™t come from whiplash. It comes from deliberate, repeatable motion. Small pushes. Stable balance. Day after day.</p>

<p>Think about what just one fix can do:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Remove one bottleneck â†’ double your output.</li>
    <li>Automate a one-hour weekly chore â†’ 52 reclaimed hours a year.</li>
    <li>Tweak your workflow â†’ unlock real focus.</li>        
    </ul>

<p>Do that once? Nice. Do that every week? Now youâ€™re dangerous.</p>
    
<p>But it only works if you stack the wins. No skipping steps. No silver bullets. Just momentum.</p>

<h2>Why small fixes beat big overhauls</h2>

<p>Most folks try to flip their lives like a light switch: <em>new system, new habits, new me!</em> Then reality slaps them, and it all unravels.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s why:</p>

<h3>Big changes are fragile</h3>

<p>Big moves break easy. One wrong moment and the whole plan folds.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>ðŸš« Commit to 5 AM workouts. One late night, you're off the rails.</li>
        <li>ðŸš« Switch to a new productivity system. Miss a day? You ghost it.</li>
        <li>ðŸš« Automate your life with copied, duct-taped scripts. One bug, and boom.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The more you bet on one big move, the more fragile your system becomes.  Bet on yourself instead.</p>

<h3>Small wins reinforce themselves</h3>

<p>Tiny, useful changes? Your brain eats that up.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>âœ… Start your day with a no-fail task â†’ instant progress.</li>
        <li>âœ… Fix one annoying friction point â†’ smoother flow.</li> 
        <li>âœ… Move one tool to a better spot â†’ less resistance.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Each win feeds the next. Momentum builds. Friction fades. You stop fighting yourself.</p>

<h3>Momentum beats willpower</h3>
    
<p>You donâ€™t need more discipline. You need less friction. You need systems that pull you forward, not ones that need constant pushing.</p>

<p>The goal isnâ€™t struggle. Itâ€™s easy. Automatic. Natural.</p>

<p>That happens when small wins stack into a rhythm you donâ€™t want to break.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>Forget the dramatic overhauls. Ditch the pressure to go big. Instead:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Fix one thing.</li>
    <li>Make it stick.</li>
    <li>Stack the next one.</li>
    <li>Keep going.</li>        
    </ul>

<p>Thatâ€™s how you go from stuck to unstoppable. Not with a revolution. With a rhythm.</p>

<p>And it starts with one simple question: <em>Whatâ€™s the <strong>smallest win</strong> you can stack today?</em></p>
