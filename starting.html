      <h1>Starting</h1>
      <p>Don't start with the tool; otherwise you'll end up trying to adapt your life to the tool, instead of the other way around.  I'm currently starting over after a bit of a tiff with my .emacs file, which had grown too big and hard to manage.</p>
      <p>This is known as "Emacs bankruptcy," but it's really just a way of evolving your system.  Don't think of it as negative.</p>
      <h2>What's the data?</h2>
      <p>This time, I kinda asked myself, "What's the data I want to manage?"  Then I can react to that data, let it drive my schedule, let it help me ideate, and so on.</p>
      <p>I've had fancy setups with all <em>kinds</em> of nuance.  Ten TODO states, dozens of tags.  Made me feel clever, but didn't help me get batter. This time, I learned from that.</p>
      <p>There are just a few places I need to worry about: home, work, shop, church, and yard.  "Yard" is different because it depends greatly on the weather, which the rest -- for the most part -- do not.  So I just made an <code>org</code> subdirectory in my homedir and added five files:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>home.org</li>
	<li>work.org</li>
	<li>shop.org</li>
	<li>church.org</li>
	<li>yard.org</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I put a <code>#+TITLE</code> line in them, and then just started using Emacs and collecting things that go in these files.  No pressure, no plan, just -- as I do things -- making a note of things I might need to do later, or things I want to do periodically.</p>
      <p>And that's a really good starting point.</p>
